Jaime Silvela has been around. In a career spanning two decades writing code,
he has lived in the US and Europe, worked for big corporations like Amazon and
Microsoft, as an early startup employee, in industries including Wall Street and
catastrophe insurance.

Early in his career he discovered a fondness for databases, PostgreSQL in
particular. He started using Go professionally in 2014, after having suffered
Java.

Jaime joined EDB in 2021, and he is very proud to be able to put his skills to
use on Kubernetes operators for databases, including CloudNativePG for PostgreSQL
workloads.
