Jaime Silvela has been around. In a career spanning two decades writing code,
he has lived in the US and Europe, worked for big corporations like Amazon and
Microsoft, as an early startup employee, in industries including Wall Street and
catastrophe insurance.

He discovered a fondness for SQL and PostgreSQL in particular years ago. He
started using Go professionally in 2014, after having suffered Java, and he is
very proud to be able to put his skills to use on CloudNativePG.
