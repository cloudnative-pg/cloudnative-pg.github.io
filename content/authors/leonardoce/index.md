I’ve been in computer science from the beginning, and programming has always
been my obsession. My passion began when I was 6 when my father taught me the
rudiments of C programming.

I’ve been working in 2ndQuadrant since 2016 as a developer and a PostgreSQL
consultant. PostgreSQL has always been my choice when working with a DBMS. I’ve
been using it since 1998. 

EDB acquired 2ndQuadrant in 2020, and CloudNativePG, the operator I
have been working on with my team since 2019, was finally released as OSS in 2022.

I’m working now as a maintainer for the CloudNative-PG project, as a developer
for EDB PostgreSQL Distributed, and as an architect for BigAnimal, EDB's
DBaaS  offering.
