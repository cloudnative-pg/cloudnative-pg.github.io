The **CloudNativePG Community** is excited to announce the release of
**CloudNativePG 1.27.0**, bringing powerful new features, stability
improvements, and extended capabilities for running PostgreSQL in Kubernetes.

---

## Highlights in 1.27.0

### Dynamic Loading of PostgreSQL Extensions

You can now use the new `.spec.postgresql.extensions` field to mount PostgreSQL
extensionsâ€”packaged as OCI-compliant container imagesâ€”as **read-only, immutable
volumes** in instance pods.
This enables [dynamic extension management](/documentation/1.27/imagevolume_extensions/)
without rebuilding base images, offering faster, more flexible extension
deployments.

### Logical Decoding Slot Synchronization

A new `synchronizeLogicalDecoding` option under
`spec.replicationSlots.highAvailability` introduces
[automatic synchronization of logical decoding slots](/documentation/1.27/replication/#logical-decoding-slot-synchronization)
across high-availability clusters. This ensures that logical replication
subscribers can continue seamlessly after a publisher failover, **improving
reliability and integration with Change Data Capture (CDC) tools**.

### Primary Isolation Check â€” Now Stable

The **liveness pinger**, introduced experimentally in 1.26, is now a stable
feature.  With `.spec.probes.liveness.isolationCheck` enabled by default, the
liveness probe now performs
[primary isolation checks](/documentation/1.27/instance_manager/#primary-isolation)
to improve detection and handling of primary connectivity issues in Kubernetes
environments.

## Other Enhancements

This release also includes:

- **Quorum-based failover** *(experimental)* â€” an opt-in feature that improves
  safety and data durability during failover events through synchronous replication.
  [Learn more](/documentation/1.27/failover/#failover-quorum-quorum-based-failover).
- **User maps for predefined users** â€” including `streaming_replica`, enabling
  the use of self-managed client certificates with different Common Names in
  environments with strict security policies or shared certificate authorities.
- **Improved plugin failure observability** â€” with a new `PhaseFailurePlugin`
  phase in `Cluster status` to better track plugin-related errors.

Full details are available in the
[release notes](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/release_notes/v1.27/).

## Upgrade Guidance

We recommend upgrading to **1.27.0** to benefit from the latest features,
enhancements, and long-term stability.

If youâ€™re on **1.26.x**, upgrade to **1.26.1** to get the latest fixes in that series.

Support for the **1.25.x** series ends on **22 August 2025** â€” plan your
migration to 1.27 or 1.26 soon.

Follow the [upgrade instructions](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/installation_upgrade/#upgrades)
for a smooth transition.

## About CloudNativePG

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) is an open-source Kubernetes
Operator specifically designed for PostgreSQL workloads. It manages the entire
lifecycle of a PostgreSQL cluster, including bootstrapping, configuration, high
availability, connection routing, and comprehensive backup and disaster
recovery mechanisms. By leveraging PostgreSQL's native streaming replication,
CloudNativePG efficiently distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones using
standard Kubernetes patterns, enabling seamless scaling of replicas in a
Kubernetes-native manner. Originally developed and supported by
[EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/), CloudNativePG is a CNCF Sandbox project
and the sole PostgreSQL operator in this category.
