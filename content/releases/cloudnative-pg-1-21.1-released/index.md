The **CloudNativePG Community** has released a new update for the supported
1.21, 1.20 and 1.19 versions of the **CloudNativePG Operator**.

Version 1.21.1 removes the previous limitation of cold backups on volume
snapshots: by default, unless differently requested, volume snapshot backups
are taken while the Postgres instance is up and running, thanks to the direct
support of the PostgreSQL API for physical online backups. A few options allow
you to configure the default behavior, and apply hybrid backup strategies
based on object store, cold volume snapshots, and hot volume snapshots.

**Versions 1.21.1, 1.20.4 and 1.19.6** are *patch releases* containing a few
bug fixes, including:

- temporary suspension of WAL archiving during a switchover
- ensure `LOCAL` synchronous commit level when managing the Postgres cluster
  replication settings
- fix customization of certificates for the streaming replication user

With this release, version 1.19 has reached End-of-Life (EOL): version 1.19.6
is the last that will be released for the 1.19 minor version.

We encourage you to update the operator at your earliest possible convenience.

# About CloudNativePg

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) is an open source Kubernetes
Operator for PostgreSQL workloads that orchestrates the full life cycle of a
PostgreSQL cluster, from bootstrapping and configuration, through high
availability and connection routing, to backups and disaster recovery.
CloudNativePG relies on PostgreSQLâ€™s native streaming replication to distribute
data across pods, nodes, and zones, using standard Kubernetes patterns.
Replicas can be scaled up and down in a Kubernetes native manner, and the
operator automatically and safely reconfigure replication as appropriate.
[CloudNativePG is a project originally created and supported by EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/cloud-native-postgresql-kubernetes-ha-clusters-k8s-containers-scalable).
