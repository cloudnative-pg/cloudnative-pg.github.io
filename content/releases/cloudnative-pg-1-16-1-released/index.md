The **CloudNativePG Community** has released a new update for the supported
1.16.x and 1.15.x versions of the **CloudNativePG Operator**.

**Versions 1.16.1 and 1.15.3** are *patch releases* containing a few bug fixes
and minor enhancements, including:

- properly manage `stopDelay` and `switchoverDelay` options which, in some cases,
  were causing the PostgreSQL restart process to hang
- logging of failover and switchover times
- presence of the PostgreSQL timeline in the cluster status
- configuration of the `huge_pages` option for PostgreSQL

We encourage you to update the operator at your earliest possible convenience.

For a complete list of changes, please refer to:
