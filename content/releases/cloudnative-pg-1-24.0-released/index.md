The **CloudNativePG Community** is excited to announce the release of
**CloudNativePG Operator** versions 1.24.0 and 1.23.4!

## CloudNativePG 1.24.0: Whatâ€™s New?

This major update introduces powerful new features and enhancements, including:

- **Distributed PostgreSQL Topologies**: Create distributed database topologies
  across multiple Kubernetes clusters, enabling hybrid and multi-cloud
  deployments. Enjoy declarative primary control and seamless switchover between
  clusters, ensuring high availability and resilience.
- **Managed Services**: The new `managed.services` stanza allows for advanced
  service management, including the ability to disable read-only and read
  services via configuration, and the use of service templates to create custom
  service resources, such as load balancers, for accessing PostgreSQL outside
  Kubernetesâ€”ideal for DBaaS scenarios.
- **Enhanced Synchronous Replication API**: Gain full control over PostgreSQLâ€™s
  synchronous replication configuration with a more flexible API, supporting
  both quorum-based and priority list strategies. Customize the
  `synchronous_standby_names` option to suit your needs.
- **WAL Disk Space Exhaustion Safeguard**: A critical safety measure ensures
  that if disk space for WAL files is exhausted, the cluster will safely stop
  rather than triggering a chain of failovers. This prevents the cluster from
  entering an unrecoverable state and simplifies recovery by allowing for manual
  volume expansion.

For a detailed overview of these features and other changes, check out the
[release notes](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.24/release_notes/v1.24/).

## About CloudNativePG

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) stands as a groundbreaking
open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for PostgreSQL workloads.
Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of a PostgreSQL cluster,
CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and configuration to ensuring
high availability, connection routing, and comprehensive backup and disaster
recovery mechanisms.
Leveraging PostgreSQL's native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, utilizing standard Kubernetes
patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a Kubernetes-native
manner, with the operator autonomously and safely reconfiguring replication as
needed.
Originally conceived and supported by [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/),
CloudNativePG represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads
within Kubernetes environments.
