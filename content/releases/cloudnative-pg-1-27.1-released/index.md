summary: The CloudNativePG community has released new updates for the 1.27, 1.26 and 1.25 versions of the CloudNativePG operator.
---

The **CloudNativePG Community** is pleased to announce the release of
**CloudNativePG Operator** versions 1.27.1, 1.26.2, and 1.25.4.

Version 1.25.4 is the final patch release for the 1.25.x series, which is now
unsupported.

These maintenance releases deliver important bug fixes and stability
improvements, ensuring your PostgreSQL clusters continue to run reliably in
production environments.

While the patch releases focus on stability, the 1.27.1 release introduces
a few key changes:

- **PostgreSQL 18 Support:** Support for **PostgreSQL 18** has been introduced,
  and the default version is now `18.0-system-trixie`. This update also adopts
  the new format for `postgres-containers`, `postgis-containers`, and
  `pgbouncer-containers` images.
- **Barman Cloud Support:** The decommissioning of native in-core support for
  Barman Cloud has been delayed until at least version 1.29.
- **Monitoring Deprecation:** The `monitoring.enablePodMonitor` field in the
  `Cluster` and `Pooler` resources has been deprecated. If you rely on
  `PodMonitor` resources, you should start planning to create them manually, as
  this field will be removed in a future release.
  
We encourage all users to upgrade to benefit from these enhancements.

## Upgrade guidance

We recommend upgrading to **1.27.1** to benefit from the latest features,
enhancements, and long-term stability.

If youâ€™re on **1.26.x**, upgrade to **1.26.2** to get the latest fixes in that
series. Users on the 1.25.x series should plan an upgrade to a supported
version.

Follow the [upgrade instructions](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/installation_upgrade/#upgrades)
