The **CloudNativePG Community** is thrilled to announce the first release
candidate of CloudNativePG 1.26! This preview release provides an opportunity
to explore new features and enhancements before the final version is officially
launched. While refinements may still occur, hereâ€™s a look at whatâ€™s new.

## Key Features

### Declarative Offline In-Place Major Upgrades of PostgreSQL

You can now trigger an [offline in-place major upgrade](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/preview/postgres_upgrades/)
by specifying a new operand container image with a higher PostgreSQL major
version in a cluster, either directly or via image catalogs. During the
upgrade, the cluster is shut down to ensure data consistency, and
`pg_upgrade` is invoked to perform the migration. This long-awaited feature simplifies
major upgrades while maintaining reliability.

### Enhanced Startup and Readiness Probes for Replicas

We have improved Kubernetes
[startup and readiness probes for PostgreSQL instances](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/preview/instance_manager/),
introducing a unique capability: the readiness of a replica can now
be controlled based on its lag from the primary. For example, this allows you
to ensure that only synchronous replicas with no lag are considered ready for
promotion, improving high availability management.

### Declarative Management of Extensions and Schemas

The `Database` resource now supports ensuring the presence of one or more
[extensions](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/preview/declarative_database_management/#managing-extensions-in-a-database)
in a database and managing their versions. Additionally, you can declaratively
define the existence of [`SCHEMA` objects](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/preview/declarative_database_management/#managing-schemas-in-a-database)
within a PostgreSQL database.

## Important Changes

Starting with this version, we are deprecating native support for Barman Cloud
on object stores. But don't worryâ€”we've got you covered! We provide clear
instructions on how to seamlessly migrate your existing clusters to the new
[Barman Cloud Plugin](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/plugin-barman-cloud).
A new resource, `BarmanObjectStore`, will replace the `.spec.barmanObjectStore`
stanza, incorporating the `.spec.backup.retentionPolicy` option.

In CloudNativePG 1.28, Barman Cloud will be fully removed from CloudNativePGâ€™s
core, making the plugin the only community-supported method for continuous
backup on object stores. You have until then to complete your migration.

This marks a significant milestone in CloudNativePGâ€™s evolutionâ€”the culmination
of a multi-year effort that introduced CNPG-I, our extensible plugin interface.
It is a crucial step toward making CloudNativePG a backup-agnostic solution
while also enabling leaner operand images by removing the need to bundle Barman
Cloud directly.

Additionally, in version 1.26, the `hibernate` command of the plugin now
leverages the declarative hibernation capability. Instead of executing an
imperative hibernation process that destroyed replica PVCs, it will now
annotate the cluster, aligning with CloudNativePGâ€™s declarative approach.

## Get Involved and Make a Difference!

This release candidate offers a unique opportunity to test the new features in your
environment before the final release. Although **not recommended for production
use**, simulating your workloads can help uncover potential issues and validate
feature stability.

Your feedback is vital to ensuring that CloudNativePG 1.26 maintains its
reputation as the premier Kubernetes operator for PostgreSQL.

## There's More...

Explore other improvements in this release, including:

- A new annotation to enable/disable webhook validation.
- A configuration option to set the TCP timeout for replicas, improving
  failover recovery speed.
- Integration with autoscalers like Karpenter for better node drain management.

[release notes for 1.26 RC1](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/preview/release_notes/v1.26/).

## Testing

The stability of each CloudNativePG release relies on the communityâ€™s
engagement. Testing your workloads with this release candidate helps identify
bugs and regressions early.
