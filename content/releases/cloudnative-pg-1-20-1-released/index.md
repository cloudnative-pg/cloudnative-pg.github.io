The **CloudNativePG Community** has released a new update for the supported
1.20, 1.19 and 1.18 versions of the **CloudNativePG Operator**.

**Versions 1.20.1, 1.19.3 and 1.18.5** are *patch releases* containing a few
bug fixes and minor enhancements, including:

- First implementation of recovery from a set of CSI VolumeSnapshot resources
  via the `.spec.bootstrap.recovery.volumeSnapshot` stanza
- `snapshot` command for the `cnpg` plugin to create a consistent cold backup
  of a Postgres cluster from a standby using the Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshot`
  standard resource
- Support for TopologySpreadConstraints to manage scheduling of instance pods
- Management of the `pg_failover_slots` extension
- `schemaOnly` option in the `import` stanza to avoid exporting/importing data
  when you bootstrap a new Postgres Cluster from an existing one

A new and improved version of the Grafana dashboard is now supplied with
CloudNativePG.

With this release, version 1.18 has reached End-of-Life (EOL): version 1.18.5
is the last that will be released for the 1.18 minor version.

We encourage you to update the operator at your earliest possible convenience.

# About CloudNativePg

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) is an open source Kubernetes
Operator for PostgreSQL workloads that orchestrates the full life cycle of a
PostgreSQL cluster, from bootstrapping and configuration, through high
availability and connection routing, to backups and disaster recovery.
CloudNativePG relies on PostgreSQLâ€™s native streaming replication to distribute
data across pods, nodes, and zones, using standard Kubernetes patterns.
Replicas can be scaled up and down in a Kubernetes native manner, and the
operator automatically and safely reconfigure replication as appropriate.
[CloudNativePG is a project originally created and supported by EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/cloud-native-postgresql-kubernetes-ha-clusters-k8s-containers-scalable).
