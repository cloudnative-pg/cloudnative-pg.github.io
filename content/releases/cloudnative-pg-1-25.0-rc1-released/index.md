The **CloudNativePG Community** is proud to unveil the first release candidate
of CloudNativePG 1.25! This release provides an opportunity to explore the
exciting features and enhancements slated for the final version. While some
refinements may still occur during this phase, hereâ€™s a glimpse of whatâ€™s new:

- **Declarative Database Management:** Simplify PostgreSQL database lifecycle
  management with the new `Database` Custom Resource Definition (CRD).

- **Declarative Logical Replication:** Use the new `Publication` and
  `Subscription` CRDs to manage logical replication, enabling tasks like online
   migrations, major version upgrades, and more, all through a declarative
   approach.

- **Enhanced Data Durability Controls:** Fine-tune your synchronous replication
  strategy with the `dataDurability` option, balancing data safety and
  self-healing capabilities.

For a complete overview of features and updates, see the [release
notes](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/preview/release_notes/v1.25/).

# About CloudNativePG

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) stands as a groundbreaking
open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for PostgreSQL workloads.
Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of a PostgreSQL cluster,
CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and configuration to ensuring
high availability, connection routing, and comprehensive backup and disaster
recovery mechanisms.
Leveraging PostgreSQL's native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, utilizing standard Kubernetes
patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a Kubernetes-native
manner, with the operator autonomously and safely reconfiguring replication as
needed.
Originally conceived and supported by [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/),
CloudNativePG represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads
within Kubernetes environments.
