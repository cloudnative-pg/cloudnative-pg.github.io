The **CloudNativePG Community** is excited to announce the release of updates
for the **CloudNativePG Operator**, now available in versions 1.24.1 and
1.23.5.

These patch releases bring key bug fixes and enhancements, including the
default deployment of PostgreSQL 17 and the addition of the `logs pretty`
command in the `cnpg` plugin, which provides a human-readable format for log
streams and filtering options for more efficient troubleshooting.

For more details, please review the full release notes:

- [Release notes for 1.24.1](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.24/release_notes/v1.24/)
- [Release notes for 1.23.5](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.23/release_notes/v1.23/)

We highly recommend updating the operator to take advantage of these
improvements.

## About CloudNativePG

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) stands as a groundbreaking
open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for PostgreSQL workloads.
Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of a PostgreSQL cluster,
CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and configuration to ensuring
high availability, connection routing, and comprehensive backup and disaster
recovery mechanisms.
Leveraging PostgreSQL's native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, utilizing standard Kubernetes
patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a Kubernetes-native
manner, with the operator autonomously and safely reconfiguring replication as
needed.
Originally conceived and supported by [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/),
CloudNativePG represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads
within Kubernetes environments.
