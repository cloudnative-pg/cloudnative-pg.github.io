summary: The CloudNativePG community has released the new 1.23 minor version and a new update for the supported 1.22 and 1.21 versions of the CloudNativePG operator.
---
The **CloudNativePG Community** is excited to announce the release of version
1.23.0 of the **CloudNativePG Operator**!

This release brings a host of new features and enhancements, including support
for PostgreSQL image catalogs, synchronization of user-defined replication
slots, and Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) configuration.

We've revised our Community support to enhance our focus and optimize resources.
The supported versions will be the last minor, plus the previous minor, which will be
supported for three months once the new minor is out.
This is in effect adding two more months of support to the outgoing minor over
what we used to have.

## What's New in 1.23

### PostgreSQL Image Catalogs

Say goodbye to PostgreSQL version management headaches! With image catalogs
based on major versions, managing your database fleet has never been easier.
Simply request the PostgreSQL major version you need and control how your
databases stay up-to-date. We've introduced two new resources
(`ClusterImageCatalog` and `ImageCatalog`) and a new stanza
(`spec.imageCatalogRef`), setting the stage for simpler management of default 
images.
The Community will provide catalogs, and you could also use third-party ones,
or even build your own.

### Synchronization of User-Defined Replication Slots

Ensure seamless failover with extended physical replication slot
synchronization, now covering persistence of user-defined slots after failover.

### Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) Configuration

Customize PDB settings with the new `.spec.enablePDB` field. Disable PDBs
on primary instances for single-instance deployments, ensuring smooth pod
eviction during maintenance operations. This marks our first step towards
deprecating the node maintenance window feature.

## Upgrade and Maintenance

Before upgrading, carefully review the
[detailed instructions](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/installation_upgrade/#upgrading-to-1230-1223-or-1215).
New patch releases are now available for all supported versions, including
1.22.3 and 1.21.5.

We recommend upgrading to CloudNativePG 1.23.0 at your earliest convenience.
Alternatively, update to the latest patch version within your current minor
release.

## End of Life Announcement

With the release of 1.23.0, the 1.21.x minor version will reach its [end of
life](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.23/supported_releases/#support-status-of-cloudnativepg-releases)
on May 24, 2024. Plan your upgrade to ensure continued support and
security.

# About CloudNativePG

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) stands as a groundbreaking
open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for PostgreSQL workloads.
Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of a PostgreSQL cluster,
CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and configuration to ensuring
high availability, connection routing, and comprehensive backup and disaster
recovery mechanisms.
Leveraging PostgreSQL's native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, utilizing standard Kubernetes
patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a Kubernetes-native
manner, with the operator autonomously and safely reconfiguring replication as
needed.

CloudNativePG represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads
within Kubernetes environments.
