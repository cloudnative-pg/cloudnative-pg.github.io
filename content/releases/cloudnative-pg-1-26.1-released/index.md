## About CloudNativePG

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) is an open-source Kubernetes
Operator specifically designed for PostgreSQL workloads. It manages the entire
lifecycle of a PostgreSQL cluster, including bootstrapping, configuration, high
availability, connection routing, and comprehensive backup and disaster
recovery mechanisms. By leveraging PostgreSQL's native streaming replication,
CloudNativePG efficiently distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones using
standard Kubernetes patterns, enabling seamless scaling of replicas in a
Kubernetes-native manner. Originally developed and supported by
[EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/), CloudNativePG is a CNCF Sandbox project
and the sole PostgreSQL operator in this category.
