summary: "CloudNativePG 1.26.0 RC3 is out, featuring key fixes for major upgrades and Barman Cloud plugin migrationâ€”test it now and help shape the final release!"
---

The **CloudNativePG Community** is pleased to announce the release of
**CloudNativePG 1.26.0 RC3**, the third release candidate before general
availability.

This release delivers important fixes identified during the first wave of
large-scale testingâ€”particularly in two critical areas:

- the transition from in-tree **Barman Cloud object store** support to the new **plugin-based architecture**, and
- the **major version upgrade** process.

Read the full changelog in the
[1.26.0 RC3 release notes](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/preview/release_notes/v1.26/).

## Barman Cloud Migration

With the 1.26 release, the **deprecation period** for in-tree Barman Cloud
support officially begins. While it remains fully functional in 1.26, we
**strongly encourage** users to begin planning the migration to the
[Barman Cloud Plugin](https://cloudnative-pg.io/plugin-barman-cloud/)
as early as possible and to adopt it for all new deployments.

To help with this, weâ€™ve published a comprehensive
[migration guide](https://cloudnative-pg.io/plugin-barman-cloud/docs/migration/)â€”
and this RC is the perfect opportunity to test it out and share your feedback.

Also, a warning will now be triggered by the admission webhook when using the
deprecated `.spec.backup.barmanObjectStore` and `.spec.backup.retentionPolicy`
fields.

## New Experimental Feature: Primary Liveness Network Isolation

RC3 introduces an opt-in **experimental enhancement** to the liveness probe that
enables detection of network isolation scenarios for primary instances. When
enabled via the `alpha.cnpg.io/livenessPinger` annotation, this feature allows
a primary that is isolated to proactively shut itself down.
