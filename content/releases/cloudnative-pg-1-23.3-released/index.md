# About CloudNativePG

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) stands as a groundbreaking
open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for PostgreSQL workloads.
Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of a PostgreSQL cluster,
CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and configuration to ensuring
high availability, connection routing, and comprehensive backup and disaster
recovery mechanisms.
Leveraging PostgreSQL's native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, using standard Kubernetes
patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a Kubernetes-native
manner, with the operator autonomously and safely reconfiguring replication as
needed.
Originally conceived and supported by [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/),
CloudNativePG represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads
within Kubernetes environments.
