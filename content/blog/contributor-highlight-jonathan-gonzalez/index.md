Building and maintaining an open source project takes a village. In a
mini-series on this blog we would like to highlight the work of our
maintainers, component owners, and members of the larger community.

Today we're meeting [Jonathan Gonzalez](https://github.com/sxd/), Senior 
Kubernetes Developer at EDB and CloudNativePG maintainer. Jonathan is part 
of the team that originally started the project. His first "real" contribution 
to the project was a commit to implement the status of PostgreSQL, a "long, 
long time ago". So historic in fact, we can't find the link, but for more 
recent work of the same ilk:  
https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/commit/041489a4280ce989cc03bc5e103040cc0488791b

One thing Jonathan would really love to see some improvement in is the 
CloudNativePG website. He would love to see it get some _TLC_. 

Baby Jonathan first got into Tech when he got a 386 computer to "do some stuff 
with a modem". Nowadays people in the CloudNativePG project reach out to him 
because he just knows a lot about a lot. "But also just to chat!" He is 
involved in other projects as well, and calls [the Prato Linux community](https://www.linux.prato.it/) home.

Jonathan is a Component owner for the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), 
and the [pgbouncer-containers](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/pgbouncer-containers), 
[pgcrash-containers](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/pgcrash-containers), 
[postgis-containers](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgis-containers), 
[postgres-containers](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-containers), 
and [postgres-trunk-containers](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-trunk-containers) 
- just, ALL the container stuff!

If you wanted to get in touch with Jonathan, you can find him in the 
CloudNativePG channels on the CNCF Slack workspace, or on 
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sxd.cl) or 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagonzalezv/).
