Building and maintaining and open source project takes a village. In a
mini-series on this blog we would like to highlight the work of our
maintainers, component owners, and members of the larger community.

This week the spotlight shines on David Wheeler, or: [_theory_](https://github.com/theory), 
Principal Architect at Tembo, and PGXN maintainer. You might have heard of 
David's work on pgTAP, a suite of database functions that make it easy to 
write TAP-emitting unit tests in `psql` scripts or xUnit-style test functions. 
Or Sqitch, the database change management application. He's also the "bull-
headed guy who ported SQL/JSON Path to Go" (WIP). The man keeps busy... 

He's not quite sure where he first heard about CloudNativePG; maybe at a 
PGConf? "I was kind of aware of it as a thing when I started at Tembo, which 
is where I actually got to know it."

His first formal contributions to the project were documentation improvements: 
defining RPO and RTO. David also advocated for [the extension search path patch](https://commitfest.postgresql.org/patch/4913/), 
a game-changing... change! 

On his list of improvements he wishes for in CloudNativePG: "I'd like to 
get the Postgres core and CloudNativePG to the point where extensions can 
be 'installed' via immutable Docker images without requiring cluster 
configuration changes (and a service restart)!"

David first got into Tech building web pages for himself and fellow grad 
students that anyone on the internet could look at in NCSA Mosaic, anywhere 
in the world. It checks out then when he next shares that he has "no intention 
of growing up", and that he'd like his legacy to be that he inspired people 
through empathy, compassion, creativity, and passion.

David is a member of several communities, including but not limited to the 
XOXO Festival, the Rands Leadership Slack, and of course the Postgres 
community. He's also himself building quite a community around the Postgres 
tooling ecosystem, organizing virtual and in-person events to discuss the 
current state and future of Postgres extension registration, packaging, and 
distribution. Keep an eye on https://justatheory.com/ so you don't miss out 
on any of the fun!

You can find David in the CloudNativePG channels on the CNCF Slack workspace, 
or [on Mastodon](https://xoxo.zone/@theory/) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/theory.fyi).
