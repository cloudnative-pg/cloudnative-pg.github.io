# Contributor Spotlight: 

Building and maintaining and open source project takes a village. In a
mini-series on this blog we would like to highlight the work of our
maintainers, component owners, and members of the larger community.

Today it's my great pleasure to introduce [Francesco Canovai](https://github.com/fcanovai/), 
my colleage at EDB. Francesco is a Senior Software Development Engineer, 
living in Prato, Italy. No point asking when he first found out about 
CloudNativePG: he was in the room when/where the project started! The 
first commit with his name on it is the initial suite of end-to-end tests.

One dream he has for the project is to rework the tests to use a configuration 
and avoid the GitHub Actions + Makefile + shell scripts + Ginkgo Frankenstein 
mix currently used. If only there were unlimited hours in the day!

Francesco got into technology in the first place playing videogames (of the 
rpg and grand strategy genre). At 15 he was sure he wanted to study computer 
science, and in his early twenties he really wanted to teach maths. It's 
never too late to switch, I don't think the world is saturated for math 
teachers. 

Today what he's really interested in, is the human side of tech and open 
source: "It amazes me to see where things go when multiple people work in 
the same general direction, even if each one's end goal is different".

If you wanted to get in touch with Francesco, you can find him in the 
CloudNativePG channels on the CNCF Slack workspace, or on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/fcanovai.bsky.social), 
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@fcanovai), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescocanovai/).
