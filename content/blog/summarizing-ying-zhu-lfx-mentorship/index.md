summary: "This summer marked our first time joining the CNCF’s LFX mentorship program—and 
it was such a great experience that we couldn’t wait to share it with you."
---

This Summer we participated in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's mentorship 
platform LFX [for the first time](https://cloudnative-pg.io/blog/lfx-cncf-mentorship/). We thought it was a great experience, 
which is why [we're participating again in the cohort that is starting in September](https://cloudnative-pg.io/blog/2025-term3-lfx-cncf-mentorship/). 

Curious about our work with [Ying](https://cloudnative-pg.io/blog/contributor-highlight-ying-zhu/)? Read on!

## Summer 2025: Declarative Management of Foreign Data Wrappers

Ying Zhu ([EdwinaZhu](https://github.com/EdwinaZhu) on GitHub), a student at Carnegie Mellon University, was 
immediately drawn to CloudNativePG when she was looking for CNCF (Cloud Native 
Computing Foundation) projects to contribute to, since she’s already involved in 
the PostgreSQL _and_ Kubernetes communities.

Ying worked on implementing [“Declarative Management of PostgreSQL Foreign Data 
Wrappers”](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/issues/8063). The project aimed to extend the CloudNativePG operator to support 
declarative configuration of foreign data wrappers through its Database custom 
resource. 

## On mentoring

Four CloudNativePG maintainers, Gabriele Bartolini, Leonardo Cecchi, Marco 
Nenciarini, and Armando Ruocco, supported Ying in her journey.

Gabriele shares how Ying worked hard, studied diligently, sought feedback, 
and grew visibly throughout the program. "Her curiosity, passion, and initiative 
stood out, and I hope that the the psychologically safe environment we tried to 
created played a key role in her progress." Gabriele is confident Ying will 
continue to make valuable contributions to the project and the wider community.

Reflecting on the collaboration, Leonardo said:

> "She is not only a skilled engineer who writes beautiful code, but she also 
brought many new, innovative ideas—and even sparked a few in us. Working with 
new people is always an enriching experience for everyone!"

Leonardo knows the value of mentorship from both perspectives. Professionally, 
he has helped colleagues transition into new roles. Personally, he experienced 
the impact of early guidance when his father taught him programming as a child 
and continued to support him throughout his career.

Looking back, there’s one piece of advice Leonardo wishes he had received early 
on—well, two, actually. First: the true purpose of software is to help people. 
Second: always weigh the value of the code you write—how much it helps—against 
the effort it takes for you and your team, both now and in the long-term 
maintenance of that code. A topic of much discussion in the CloudNativePG Slack. 

## What's next?

Ying has done an outstanding job with her initial mentorship commitment, and 
[the patch](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7942) she 
has provided is almost ready to be merged—after the release of version 1.27.0 
the pull request will be incorporated into v1.28.

We're so happy to work with Ying that we've decided to extend the mentorship 
project (which ends on Aug 29) to its next phase, focusing on foreign servers 
with issue [[Feature]: Declarative support for foreign servers #8063](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/issues/8063), 
which will presumably enter 1.28 too.

More to come!
