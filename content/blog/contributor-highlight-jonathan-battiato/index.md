Building and maintaining an open source project takes a village. In a
mini-series on this blog we would like to highlight the work of our
maintainers, component owners, and members of the larger community.

Today we meet [Jonathan Battiato](https://github.com/jbattiato), an engineer 
on the Cloud Native team at EDB. He was working on 2ndQuadrant’s Cloud Native 
team when the CloudNativePG project (then under a different name) was first 
conceived. His first contribution to the project must have been reported a bug, 
Jonathan says he's "good at breaking things". Most of his contributions since 
then have been in improving the user experience.

Even though the CloudNativePG Operator is a stable, easy-to-use, and a 
production-ready product, there are many aspects of the project that still 
require improvements and/or rewriting. Most of them are already on the roadmap. 
Jonathan is keen to improve the user experience for the docs. "The documentation 
is... a lot. Sometimes I worry one could get lost in it." Jonathan had hoped 
to work on some hands-on-labs style tutorials to be published on the 
website, but simply hasn't had the time to dedicate to it. 

Jonathan is as a long-time member of the local Linux User Group (in Prato). 
While he's been more of a lurker than an active member of any other community, 
he's changing this with his involvement in the Data on Kubernetes community. 
Giving talks, and writing a knowledge base about benchmarking storage solutions 
in Kubernetes, is what earned him his DoK Ambassador status.

Jonathan got into technology because of tv shows like Ghostbusters, MacGyver, 
and A-Team. "I’ve always been interested in science and technology. When my 
best friend introduced me to Linux through the Debian project, my fate was 
decided. Since then, I worked as a Linux SysAdmin, a PostgreSQL Admin, and a 
Kubernetes Admin." It takes a special kind of nerd to answer the question 
"what are you most notorious for?" with: my PostgreSQL benchmarks...

When he (finally) grows up, Jonathan wants to be an astronaut, looking for 
new civilizations like in Star Trek. "Earthlings are disappointing." Present 
company not withstanding, I hope.

You can find Jonathan in the CloudNativePG channels on the CNCF Slack workspace, 
or [on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jonnylee), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanbattiato/).
