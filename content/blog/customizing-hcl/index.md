summary: Jonathan Gonzalez wrote a guide on this blog detailing how to customize Docker images by using an override hcl file. I tried it for a spin.

## Summary

The other week [Jonathan Gonzalez]({{% ref "/authors/jgonzalez/" %}}) wrote an 
article on
[how to customize docker images using an override hcl file]({{% ref "/blog/building-images-bake/" %}}).
Before the [postgres-containers repo](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-containers) 
was enhanced with the option to build the images with `docker build bake`, 
I had to follow these steps manually in order to have custom images for our workloads.

- clone the repo
- edit the dockerfile
- build the image
- push it to the registry

Edit, build and push had to be done for each PostgreSQL version.
So a lot of boring work needed to be done in order to have updated images.
The chance to avoid this work sounded promising to me, so I started with the 
[hcl file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg.github.io/refs/heads/main/content/blog/building-images-bake/bake.hcl) 
Jonathan wrote, and adapted it to fit my needs.
After a troubleshooting session with Jonathan, he asked me to share the changes I made.
So here are my detailed instructions, in case they could prove useful to others.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the local Bake file

To build a custom image we add the following content in a local file with name 
`bake.hcl`:

```hcl
platforms = [
  "linux/amd64",
]

extensions = [
  "dbgsym",
  "partman",
  "oracle-fdw",
  "squeeze",
  "show-plans",
  "cron",
  "tds-fdw",
]

target "myimage" {
  dockerfile-inline = <<EOT
ARG BASE_IMAGE="ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:16.9-standard-bookworm"
FROM $BASE_IMAGE AS myimage
ARG EXTENSIONS
USER root
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends $EXTENSIONS \
    ldap-utils \
    ca-certificates \
    openssl \
    procps \
    postgresql-plpython3-"${getMajor(pgVersion)}" \
    python3-psutil \
    pgtop \
    pg-activity \
    nmon \
    libsybdb5 \
    freetds-dev \
    freetds-common && \
    apt-get purge -y --auto-remove -o APT::AutoRemove::RecommendsImportant=false && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /var/cache/* /var/log/*
RUN sed -i -e 's/# de_AT.UTF-8 UTF-8/de_AT.UTF-8 UTF-8/' /etc/locale.gen && \
        locale-gen
ADD https://your.git.url/postgresql/-/blob/main/.psqlrc?ref_type=heads /var/lib/postgresql/
ADD https://your.git.url/cloudnativepg/-/blob/main/bake/files/etc/ldap/ldap.conf?ref_type=heads /etc/ldap/
ADD https://your.git.url/cloudnativepg/-/blob/main/bake/files/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/EuropeanSSLServerCA2.crt?ref_type=heads /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
ADD https://your.git.url/cloudnativepg/-/blob/main/bake/files/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/RootCA1v0.crt?ref_type=heads /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
ADD https://your.git.url/cloudnativepg/-/blob/main/bake/files/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/SubCA1v1.crt?ref_type=heads /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
RUN update-ca-certificates 
USER 26
EOT
  matrix = {
    tgt = [
      "myimage"
    ]
    pgVersion = [
      "13.21",
      "14.18",
      "15.13",
      "16.9",
      "17.5",
    ]
  }
  name = "postgresql-${index(split(".",cleanVersion(pgVersion)),0)}-standard-bookworm"
  target = "${tgt}"
  args = {
    BASE_IMAGE = "ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:${cleanVersion(pgVersion)}-standard-bookworm",
    EXTENSIONS = "${getExtensionsString(pgVersion, extensions)}",
  }
}
```

Starting at the beginning of the file:

- The `platforms` variable is `linux/amd64` for all of my images.
- The `extensions` variable contains some extensions I use regularly.
- The `dockerfile-inline` part is extended with binaries, some of them are handy
 to have, some needed by extensions or other tools I use e.g. [pgwatch](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pgwatch).
- With the `sed` command I add needed locales and build them.
- With the `ADD` commands I extend the image with
  - .psqlrc file, to have a nice psql Command-line even when connecting via 
  `kubectl cnpg psql XXX`
  - ldap.conf and the needed certs

### Step 2: Build the image

We can now build the image using the following command:

```bash
environment=production registry=your.repo.url docker buildx bake -f docker-bake.hcl -f cwd://bake.hcl "https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-containers.git" myimage
```

- The `environment` variable is set to `production` for all of my images, 
because I use the same image to stage it through dev/test/prod.
- The `registry` variable contains the repo upload url, so the images get 
uploaded there instead of the `localhost:5000` registry used in the 
[hcl file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg.github.io/refs/heads/main/content/blog/building-images-bake/bake.hcl).

### Step 3: Use it

The only missing step to use the images is to update your 
[Image Catalog / Cluster Image Catalog](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/image_catalog/) 
with the newly built images.
Test them and stage them through your environment.

## Conclusion

Once you prepare the override file to fit to your needs, the only manual steps 
to build new images are

- udpate the `pgVersion` variable
- run the `docker buildx bake` command
  
I hope this helps streamline your image customization process as much as it 
did mineâ€”feel free to build on it, and share your own improvements too!
