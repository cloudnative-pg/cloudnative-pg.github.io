The **CloudNativePG Community** has released a new update for the supported
1.18, 1.17 and 1.16 versions of the **CloudNativePG Operator**.

**Versions 1.18.1, 1.17.3 and 1.16.5** are *patch releases* containing a few
bug fixes and minor enhancements, including:

- better integration with identity management authentication in GKE or EKS via
  customization of labels and annotations for the service account
- support for `nodeAffinity`
- support for Istio's quit endpoint to prevent jobs like init and recovery from
  running indefinitely
- `fio` command in the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl`

With this release, version 1.16 has reached End-of-Life (EOL): version 1.16.5
is the last that will be released for the 1.16 minor version.

We encourage you to update the operator at your earliest possible convenience.

# About CloudNativePg

[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io) is an open source Kubernetes
Operator for PostgreSQL workloads that orchestrates the full life cycle of a
PostgreSQL cluster, from bootstrapping and configuration, through high
availability and connection routing, to backups and disaster recovery.
CloudNativePG relies on PostgreSQLâ€™s native streaming replication to distribute
data across pods, nodes, and zones, using standard Kubernetes patterns.
Replicas can be scaled up and down in a Kubernetes native manner, and the
operator automatically and safely reconfigure replication as appropriate.
[CloudNativePG is a project originally created and supported by EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/cloud-native-postgresql-kubernetes-ha-clusters-k8s-containers-scalable).
