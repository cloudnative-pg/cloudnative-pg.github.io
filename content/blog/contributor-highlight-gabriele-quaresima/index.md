Building and maintaining an open source project takes a village. In a
mini-series on this blog we would like to highlight the work of our
maintainers, component owners, and members of the larger community.

Gabriele Quaresima ([gabriele-wolfox](https://github.com/gabriele-wolfox) on GitHub) is a Staff Software Engineer 
at EDB, where he builds products on top of CloudNativePG. When he joined the 
company, he immediately started to work with the CloudNativePG team. The open 
source operator and the closed source ones running on top of it represent his 
learning path and entry point to the Kubernetes, and the PostgreSQL world.

Gabriele now feels at home in the PostgreSQL and the Kubernetes communities. 
"I attended several PGDays and KCD / CND (Kubernetes Community Days / Cloud 
Native Days) events as a speaker and attendee both, and I really enjoyed it!"

His first contribution to CloudNativePG was [feat: customize labels and 
annotations for the service account #1105](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/1105), regarding customization 
of labels and annotations for the service account. But reviewing PRs opened 
by others has been the main way Gabriele has contributed to the project - at 
the same time it has been the thing that contributed to his own development as 
well. 

Given a magic wand, the one thing Gabriele would like to improve is the project 
adopting tools like [modernize](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/modernize/cmd/modernize) and linters to optimize workflows.

How he got interested in technology is a familiar story. "I started playing 
with my Commodore 64 at 5 years old. I spent at least 1 to 2 hours in front of 
a monitor from an early age on." Gabriele then started using Linux at University, 
and discovered the world of open source. His dream however was to become a writer 
and win the Nobel prize, so exactly how he got into software engineering is fuzzy. 

"I have always loved doing nerdy stuff, like playing board games, attending World 
Championship of sudoku and logic puzzles, but I guess playing saxophones and flutes 
is currently the hobby I am wrapped up in."

If you wanted to get in touch with Gabriele, you can find him in the 
CloudNativePG channels on the CNCF Slack workspace, or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-quaresima). You can 
follow the CloudNativePG project on [Bluesky](https://cloudnativepg.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@CloudNativePG) too!
