The **CloudNativePG Community** has released a new update for the supported 1.15.x
version of the **CloudNativePG Operator**.

**Version 1.15.1** is a *patch release* containing a few bug fixes and minor
enhancements, in particular in the backup and recovery area, including:

- Ownership of Backup objects for finer control of cleanup operations in the
  Kubernetes cluster
- Configurable archive timeout parameter, by default fixed to 5 minutes, which
  is relevant to set the upper limit of the recovery point objective (RPO) of a
  Postgres cluster
- Enhanced verification of backup and recovery object stores to ensure that an
  object store can only be written by one Postgres cluster
- Automated export of the `pg_stat_wal` stats view available from PostgreSQL 14
  onwards


We encourage you to update the operator at your earliest possible convenience.

For a complete list of changes, please refer to the
[release notes](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.15.1/release_notes/).
