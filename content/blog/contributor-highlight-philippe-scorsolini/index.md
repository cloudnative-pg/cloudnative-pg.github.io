Building and maintaining and open source project takes a village. In a
mini-series on this blog we would like to highlight the work of our
maintainers, component owners, and members of the larger community.

Today's spotlight: [Philippe Scorsolini](https://github.com/phisco/), 
based in Italy. Philippe is a Staff Software Engineer and Tech Lead at 
Upbound, working on their Spaces product, and maintaining the Crossplane 
project.

Coming from an infrastructure background, Philippe focused on Kubernetes 
and only used PostgreSQL as a user, not as an administrator. "However, 
I was always fascinated by PostgreSQL!" So, when the team at EDB reached 
out for a position working on a Kubernetes controller for it, he accepted 
right away. That operator of course is now known as CloudNativePG. "Once 
it was open-sourced, although I wasn’t working on it full-time anymore, 
they honored me by making me a maintainer."

His first contribution to the project was small, just adding a name to 
the metrics port to allow it to be easily discovered by the Prometheus 
operator. The next one was more interesting since Philippe was one of the 
people introducing the current framework used to parse Postgres logs and 
output them in JSON. If he could ask for one thing to be improved in 
CloudNativePG, it would have to be the Pooler resource. "Through the years, 
as a CloudNativePG user, I’ve ended up hitting a few of its limitations. 
We always wanted to support more poolers, but never got around to it." Yet.

Philippe grew up in a small city in Italy nearby the border with Slovenia, 
and then moved to Milan when he went to University. He was always interested 
in technology, not just computers, but more broadly understanding how things 
worked. "I enjoy experimenting and iterating fast. Technology, and open-source 
more specifically, was just the best playground I could find for merging the 
two aspects: everything is just a few clicks away, and iterating has negligible 
costs." Philippe does not expect he'll ever lose interest.

If you wanted to get in touch with Philippe, you can find him in the 
CloudNativePG channels on the CNCF Slack workspace, or on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Phisc0) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/phisco.bsky.social).
