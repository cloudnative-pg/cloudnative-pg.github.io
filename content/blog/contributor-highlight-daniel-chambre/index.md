Building and maintaining and open source project takes a village. In a
mini-series on this blog we would like to highlight the work of our
maintainers, component owners, and members of the larger community.


Today we're meeting Daniel Chambre, better known under his handle: 
[smiyc](https://github.com/smiyc/). Daniel is a DBA at WienIT, working part 
remotely from "the outskirts of Vienna". He first learned about CNP, EDB's 
Kubernetes operator for Postgres, in late 2021. The CloudNativePG project was 
spun off not much later. 

Daniel first got involved with the project back in November 2022, by starting 
a discussion around how the controller manager demanded pvc resizing which 
was unsupported by the storageclass. He's been active in the project and the 
project's Slack channel(s) ever since. This is the first open-source community 
Daniel has been an active part of.

What got Daniel interested in technology in the first place was "fixing broken 
stuff", like VCRs, with his dad, and also a Commodore 64 (giving away his 
age there). Later Daniel got into PS2 soldering shenanigans. 

What he wishes hardest for that would get implemented in CloudNativePG are 
automated switchover / failover, to distributed replica cluster via service 
mesh. If only the maintainers would read this blog!

If you wanted to get in touch with Daniel, you can find him in the 
CloudNativePG channels on the CNCF Slack workspace!
