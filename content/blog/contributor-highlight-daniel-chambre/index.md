Building and maintaining and open source project takes a village. In a
mini-series on this blog we would like to highlight the work of our
maintainers, component owners, and members of the larger community.


Today we're meeting Daniel Chambre, better known under his handle: 
[smiyc](https://github.com/smiyc/). Daniel is a DBA at WienIT, working part 
remotely from "the outskirts of Vienna". He first learned about CNP by/for EDB 
in late 2021, and then CloudNativePG at the time it was released. 

Daniel first got involved with the project by filing an Issue, that resulted 
in a discussion, in November 2022. He's been active in the project and the 
project's Slack channel(s) ever since. A new thing, previously Daniel wasn't 
really involved in any communities. What got Daniel interested in technology 
in the first place was "fixing broken stuff", like VCRs, with his dad, and 
also a Commodore 64 (giving away his age there). Later Daniel got into PS2 
soldering shenanigans. 

What he wishes hardest for that would get implemented in CloudNativePG are 
automated switchover / failover, to distributed replica cluster via service 
mesh. If only the maintainers would read this blog!

If you wanted to get in touch with Daniel, you can find him in the 
CloudNativePG channels on the CNCF Slack workspace!
