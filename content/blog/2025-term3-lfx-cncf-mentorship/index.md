summary: "We have proposed 3 projects for the September cohort of the CNCF's LFX Mentorship 
    program, and we’re looking for mentees to sign up and receive a stipend for 
    their work."
---

The LFX Mentorship Program, run by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), 
connects mentees with CNCF projects to foster open source contributions. 
Since its launch in 2019, the program has welcomed over 190 mentees across 96 
mentorships. [CloudNativePG joined the program for the first time in the June cohort](https://cloudnative-pg.io/blog/lfx-cncf-mentorship/) 
and had a fantastic experience. We're excited to return for Term 3 starting in 
September, this time with three proposed projects!

Learn more about the projects below:

### [Refresh cnpg-i-hello-world to align with current CNPG-I](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/cabc7391-4956-42b2-b91c-d261816b7289) 

The cnpg-i-hello-world project was originally designed to help developers get 
started with building plugins for CloudNativePG using the CNPG-I framework. 
However, it's now outdated and in need of a thorough update to align with the 
current CNPG-I interface, best practices, and development patterns. The goal is 
to modernize the codebase, enhance its usefulness as a learning and prototyping 
tool, and improve documentation and examples to better support developers 
working with CNPG-I.

Mentors: [Armando Ruocco](https://github.com/armru), [Gabriele Bartolini](https://github.com/gbartolini), [Marco Nenciarini](https://github.com/mnencia)


### [Chaos Testing](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/0858ce07-0c90-47fa-a1a0-95c6762f00ff) 

We aim to enhance CloudNativePG's test coverage by introducing a comprehensive 
chaos testing framework to validate its resilience, fault tolerance, and 
recovery capabilities. This involves selecting a Kubernetes-native tool (such 
as LitmusChaos or Chaos Mesh), designing automated chaos experiments for common 
failure scenarios, integrating them into CI/CD workflows, and collecting 
observability metrics like failover time and data consistency. 

Clear documentation and contributor guidelines will support the safe creation 
and execution of future chaos tests.

Mentors: [Gabriele Bartolini](https://github.com/gbartolini), [Marco Nenciarini](https://github.com/mnencia)

### [Rebuild documentation for multi-version support with Docusaurus](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/86a647c1-88c7-474f-b093-6abb58197083)

We plan to modernize the CloudNativePG documentation by rebuilding the site 
using Docusaurus (or a similar static site generator) to support multi-version 
documentation, allowing users to easily access version-specific content relevant 
to their production environments. This initiative includes improving the site’s 
structure, navigation, and search functionality, while ensuring alignment with 
CNCF standards and user expectations. The documentation will continue to be 
hosted on GitHub Pages, with a new deployment workflow using Dagger and GitHub 
Actions. The outcome will include a working version selector, a cleaner content 
structure, and a contributor guide to support ongoing maintenance and updates.
