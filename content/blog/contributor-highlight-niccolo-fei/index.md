Building and maintaining an open source project takes a village. In a 
mini-series on this blog we would like to highlight the work of our
maintainers, component owners, and members of the larger community.

Niccolò Fei ([niccolofei](https://github.com/niccolofei) on GitHub) is a Kubernetes Administrator and Automation Engineer 
at EDB. Like some of the other CloudNativePG maintainers and contributors, 
Niccolò was part of the team at 2ndQuadrant (acquired by EDB in 2020) when 
the initial project (CNP / Cloud Native PostgreSQL) started.

Niccolò made his first contribution to the CloudNativePG project in December 
2020, when he developed a set of end-to-end (E2E) tests to verify core 
functionalities such as configuration changes, rolling updates, switchover, 
and synchronous replication. This initial contribution not only served as a 
practical introduction to the project’s E2E testing suite but also offered 
valuable insight into the fundamental principles behind CloudNativePG. To this 
day, Niccolò considers it a great starting point for anyone looking to begin 
contributing to the project.

If he had unlimited time and skills to dedicate, Niccolò says he would focus 
on improving support for dynamically loading PostgreSQL extensions in running 
clusters—a feature he has recently been working on. In fact, the first 
implementation of this capability has just been included in the [1.27.0 release 
candidate](https://cloudnative-pg.io/releases/cloudnative-pg-1-27.0-rc1-released/)!

"Looking ahead, I expect to see many additional features and refinements in 
this area, such as support for extensions in ImageCatalogs." PostgreSQL’s 
extensibility and adaptability are some of its greatest strengths, and this 
new approach to managing extensions introduces meaningful improvements in 
security, maintainability, and overall flexibility.

Active in the Postgres and Kubernetes communities, Niccolò has a strong 
interest in automation and DevOps tooling. His passion for technology began 
early: “I’ve been fascinated by computers since childhood—mostly because of 
video games and my love for sci-fi movies and books. Growing up, I started 
buying and selling hardware, building PCs for myself and friends, and 
experimenting with different Linux distributions. I always knew I wanted to 
work in this field, so when the opportunity to work with PostgreSQL and
 databases came along, I jumped at the chance!”

Niccolò's future is almost certainly intertwined with OSS: "I will continue 
to contribute to open source—it's a fantastic way to keep learning while 
building things that can help others."

If you wanted to get in touch with Niccolò, you can find him in the 
CloudNativePG channels on the CNCF Slack workspace, or on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/niccolofei.bsky.social), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niccolofei/). You can follow the CloudNativePG project on [Bluesky](https://cloudnativepg.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@CloudNativePG) too!
