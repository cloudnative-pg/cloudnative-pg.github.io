> At Tembo, we've been using CloudNative-PG since early 2023 to power our PostgreSQL database-as-a-service offering. Since launching our cloud service in May 2023, we've successfully deployed and managed thousands of production PostgreSQL databases entirely through CNPG's Kubernetes operator. The project has provided us with exceptional reliability, simplified operations, and seamless scaling capabilities that form the backbone of our commercial offering. What impressed us most was how quickly we were able to integrate CNPG into our infrastructure and the consistent performance it's delivered as we've scaled. We're excited about CloudNative-PG's continued evolution and remain committed to building on this robust foundation as we continue to expand our services.
