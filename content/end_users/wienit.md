> _We've discovered CloudNativePG in April 2022 while searching for a HA PostgreSQL solution.
After comparing it to the Zalando Operator we decided to go with CloudNativePG because of the excellent documentation and most of all the supportive community.
Since April 2024 we are running CloudNativePG as our main PostgreSQL platform.
We're excited about the future of the project as part of the CNCF Landscape!_
