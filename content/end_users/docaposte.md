> At Docaposte, we have been using CloudNativePG in production since January 2024 to manage our PostgreSQL workloads on Kubernetes. We chose CloudNativePG over other solutions because it offers the most elegant and efficient way to run PostgreSQL on Kubernetes. Today, in our business unit, most of our projects—whether for private customers or the French government—rely on CloudNativePG.
