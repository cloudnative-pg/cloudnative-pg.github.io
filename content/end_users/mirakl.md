> _MIRAKL has been using CloudNativePG in production since February 2024 to support our marketplace operation workload (450 Pg clusters, 31 TB of data, 3650 CPUs & 20 TB of RAM-between 2 & 64 CPU per cluster) and it's so much better than our previous stack using cloud virtual machines provisioned with Ansible & Terraform code. We're really excited about all the improvements we have discovered in the releases that we have seen since, and the future of the project!_
