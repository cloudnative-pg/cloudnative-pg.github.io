CNCF defines end users as follows:

> End users are organizations that use cloud native technologies internally and
> do not sell any cloud native services externally. This excludes vendors,
> consultancies, training partners, telcos.

The full updated list of end users can be found in the
[CNPG ADOPTERS page](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md#cloudnativepg-adopters).

**If you want to add your organization**, please open a pull request for the
[ADOPTERS file](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md).
Once you have a published entry there, you may open a pull request to add your
organization to the list of End Users in this repo. Note that the
`weight` field in the front matter needs to be populated according to the order
in `ADOPTERS.md`.
Please check the README in the `end_users` folder or seek asistance from
maintainers to assign the correct `weight` to your enty.

Below is a list of several CloudNativePG end users, in chronological order.
