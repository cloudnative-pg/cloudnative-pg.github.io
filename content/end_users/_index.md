CNCF defines end users as follows:

> End users are organizations that use cloud native technologies internally and
> do not sell any cloud native services externally. This excludes vendors,
> consultancies, training partners, telcos.

The full updated list of end users can be found in the
[CNPG ADOPTERS page](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md#cloudnativepg-adopters).
If you want to add your organization, please open a pull request for the
[ADOPTERS file](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md).


Below is a list of several CloudNativePG end users, in chronological order.
