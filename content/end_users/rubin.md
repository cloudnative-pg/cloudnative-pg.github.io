> _At Rubin Observatory, we adopted CloudNativePG in November 2022 to manage our PostgreSQL databases on our on-premises Kubernetes clusters. It was actually my first project after joining Rubin, and from the very beginning, CloudNativePG stood out for its simplicity and how seamlessly it fit into our workflow. One feature we really appreciate is how well it works with our custom PostgreSQL images, which include several specialized extensions we need for astronomy data. Having PgBouncer integration available out of the box is a great bonus and something we actively use. Today, CloudNativePG is at the core of all the data collected by the telescope and replicated to SLAC, powering our science platform for millions of users around the world. For us, it’s a straightforward, reliable solution that just works—even at the scale of modern astronomy._
