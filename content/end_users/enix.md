> _At Enix, we've been using CloudNativePG since its early versions in 2022. 
It's the most comprehensive and relevant operator for deploying PostgreSQL 
databases within Kubernetes clusters. We use it in production on the IT 
platforms we manage for our clients, where high availability and scalability 
are critical requirements._
