> _CloudNativePG gives us the mature, production-ready Postgres operator we can depend on. Using the pgEdge Helm chart, our customers can run either single-region setups or multi-region, active-active pgEdge Enterprise Postgres deployments, powered by CloudNativePG. By leaning on CloudNativePG for lifecycle management and day 2 operations, we can focus our energy on delivering advanced distributed Postgres capabilities instead of rebuilding core operational plumbing._
