> At cndi.dev, we build interactive Templates for best-in-class cloud-native applications, and CloudNativePG has proven to be an exceptional solution for running PostgreSQL on Kubernetes. Its robust performance and seamless integration—as showcased in our CloudNativePG support at cndi.dev/templates/postgres—make it not only the most effective way to manage PostgreSQL in Kubernetes but also one of the most well-built and well-supported Kubernetes Operators in the ecosystem.
