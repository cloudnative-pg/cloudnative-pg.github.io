> At ParadeDB, we've been using CloudNativePG since summer 2024 to support our bring-your-own-cloud database deployments. We evaluated other Postgres Kubernetes operators and concluded that CloudNativePG was the right solution due to being vendor-neutral and battle tested in production. We've been particularly happy with the responsiveness of the operator and have not looked back since.
