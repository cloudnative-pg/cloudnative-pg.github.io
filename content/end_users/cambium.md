> We switched to CloudNativePG 1.5 years ago, using it for all our "gold" layers. It'ss the main source that we connect to business / location (geospatial) intelligence layers. Our "alternative" was a single node dockerized vm, but CloudNativePG excels at making it really easy to scale, configure tablespaces, backups, perform migrations, you name it!
