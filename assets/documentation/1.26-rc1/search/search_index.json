This documentation page provides an overview of the key architectural considerations for implementing a robust business continuity strategy when deploying PostgreSQL in Kubernetes. These considerations include: Deployments in stretched vs. non-stretched clusters : Evaluating the differences between deploying in stretched clusters (across 3 or more availability zones) versus non-stretched clusters (within a single availability zone). Reservation of postgres worker nodes : Isolating PostgreSQL workloads by dedicating specific worker nodes to postgres tasks, ensuring optimal performance and minimizing interference from other workloads. PostgreSQL architectures within a single Kubernetes cluster : Designing effective PostgreSQL deployments within a single Kubernetes cluster to meet high availability and performance requirements. PostgreSQL architectures across Kubernetes clusters for disaster recovery : Planning and implementing PostgreSQL architectures that span multiple Kubernetes clusters to provide comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities. Synchronizing the state PostgreSQL is a database management system and, as such, it needs to be treated as a stateful workload in Kubernetes. While stateless applications mainly use traffic redirection to achieve High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR), in the case of a database, state must be replicated in multiple locations, preferably in a continuous and instantaneous way, by adopting either of the following two strategies: storage-level replication , normally persistent volumes application-level replication , in this specific case PostgreSQL CloudNativePG relies on application-level replication, for a simple reason: the PostgreSQL database management system comes with robust and reliable built-in physical replication capabilities based on Write Ahead Log (WAL) shipping , which have been used in production by millions of users all over the world for over a decade. PostgreSQL supports both asynchronous and synchronous streaming replication over the network, as well as asynchronous file-based log shipping (normally used as a fallback option, for example, to store WAL files in an object store). Replicas are usually called standby servers and can also be used for read-only workloads, thanks to the Hot Standby feature. Important We recommend against storage-level replication with PostgreSQL , although CloudNativePG allows you to adopt that strategy. For more information, please refer to the talk given by Chris Milsted and Gabriele Bartolini at KubeCon NA 2022 entitled \"Data On Kubernetes, Deploying And Running PostgreSQL And Patterns For Databases In a Kubernetes Cluster\" where this topic was covered in detail. Kubernetes architecture Kubernetes natively provides the possibility to span separate physical locations - also known as data centers, failure zones, or more frequently availability zones - connected to each other via redundant, low-latency, private network connectivity. Being a distributed system, the recommended minimum number of availability zones for a Kubernetes cluster is three (3), in order to make the control plane resilient to the failure of a single zone. For details, please refer to \"Running in multiple zones\" . This means that each data center is active at any time and can run workloads simultaneously. Note Most of the public Cloud Providers' managed Kubernetes services already provide 3 or more availability zones in each region. Multi-availability zone Kubernetes clusters The multi-availability zone Kubernetes architecture with three (3) or more zones is the one that we recommend for PostgreSQL usage. This scenario is typical of Kubernetes services managed by Cloud Providers. Such an architecture enables the CloudNativePG operator to control the full lifecycle of a Cluster resource across the zones within a single Kubernetes cluster, by treating all the availability zones as active: this includes, among other operations, scheduling the workloads in a declarative manner (based on affinity rules, tolerations and node selectors), automated failover, self-healing, and updates. All will work seamlessly across the zones in a single Kubernetes cluster. Please refer to the \"PostgreSQL architecture\" section below for details on how you can design your PostgreSQL clusters within the same Kubernetes cluster through shared-nothing deployments at the storage, worker node, and availability zone levels. Additionally, you can leverage Kubernetes clusters to deploy distributed PostgreSQL topologies hosting \"passive\" PostgreSQL replica clusters in different regions and managing them via declarative configuration. This setup is ideal for disaster recovery (DR), read-only operations, or cross-region availability. Important Each operator deployment can only manage operations within its local Kubernetes cluster. For operations across Kubernetes clusters, such as controlled switchover or unexpected failover, coordination must be handled manually (through GitOps, for example) or by using a higher-level cluster management tool. Single availability zone Kubernetes clusters If your Kubernetes cluster has only one availability zone, CloudNativePG still provides you with a lot of features to improve HA and DR outcomes for your PostgreSQL databases, pushing the single point of failure (SPoF) to the level of the zone as much as possible - i.e. the zone must have an outage before your CloudNativePG clusters suffer a failure. This scenario is typical of self-managed on-premise Kubernetes clusters, where only one data center is available. Single availability zone Kubernetes clusters are the only viable option when only two data centers are available within reach of a low-latency connection (typically in the same metropolitan area). Having only two zones prevents the creation of a multi-availability zone Kubernetes cluster, which requires a minimum of three zones. As a result, users must create two separate Kubernetes clusters in an active/passive configuration, with the second cluster primarily used for Disaster Recovery (see the replica cluster feature ). Hint If you are at en early stage of your Kubernetes journey, please share this document with your infrastructure team. The two data centers setup might be simply the result of a \"lift-and-shift\" transition to Kubernetes from a traditional bare-metal or VM based infrastructure, and the benefits that Kubernetes offers in a 3+ zone scenario might not have been known, or addressed at the time the infrastructure architecture was designed. Ultimately, a third physical location connected to the other two might represent a valid option to consider for organization, as it reduces the overall costs of the infrastructure by moving the day-to-day complexity from the application level down to the physical infrastructure level. Please refer to the \"PostgreSQL architecture\" section below for details on how you can design your PostgreSQL clusters within your single availability zone Kubernetes cluster through shared-nothing deployments at the storage and worker node levels only. For HA, in such a scenario it becomes even more important that the PostgreSQL instances be located on different worker nodes and do not share the same storage. For DR, you can push the SPoF above the single zone, by using additional Kubernetes clusters to define a distributed topology hosting \"passive\" PostgreSQL replica clusters . As with other Kubernetes workloads in this scenario, promotion of a Kubernetes cluster as primary must be done manually. Through the replica cluster feature , you can define a distributed PostgreSQL topology and coordinate a controlled switchover between data centers by first demoting the primary cluster and then promoting the replica cluster, without the need to re-clone the former primary. While failover is now fully declarative, automated failover across Kubernetes clusters is not within CloudNativePG's scope, as the operator can only function within a single Kubernetes cluster. Important CloudNativePG provides all the necessary primitives and probes to coordinate PostgreSQL active/passive topologies across different Kubernetes clusters through a higher-level operator or management tool. Reserving nodes for PostgreSQL workloads Whether you're operating in a multi-availability zone environment or, more critically, within a single availability zone, we strongly recommend isolating PostgreSQL workloads by dedicating specific worker nodes exclusively to postgres in production. A Kubernetes worker node dedicated to running PostgreSQL workloads is referred to as a Postgres node or postgres node. This approach ensures optimal performance and resource allocation for your database operations. Hint As a general rule of thumb, deploy Postgres nodes in multiples of three\u2014ideally with one node per availability zone. Three nodes is an optimal number because it ensures that a PostgreSQL cluster with three instances (one primary and two standby replicas) is distributed across different nodes, enhancing fault tolerance and availability. In Kubernetes, this can be achieved using node labels and taints in a declarative manner, aligning with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices: labels ensure that a node is capable of running postgres workloads, while taints help prevent any non- postgres workloads from being scheduled on that node. Important This methodology is the most straightforward way to ensure that PostgreSQL workloads are isolated from other workloads in terms of both computing resources and, when using locally attached disks, storage. While different PostgreSQL clusters may share the same node, you can take this a step further by using labels and taints to ensure that a node is dedicated to a single instance of a specific Cluster . Proposed node label CloudNativePG recommends using the node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres label. Since this is a reserved label ( *.kubernetes.io ), it can only be applied after a worker node is created. To assign the postgres label to a node, use the following command: kubectl label node <NODE-NAME> node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres= To ensure that a Cluster resource is scheduled on a postgres node, you must correctly configure the .spec.affinity.nodeSelector stanza in your manifests. Here\u2019s an example: spec: # <snip> affinity: # <snip> nodeSelector: node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres: \"\" Proposed node taint CloudNativePG recommends using the node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres taint. To assign the postgres taint to a node, use the following command: kubectl taint node <NODE-NAME> node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres=:NoSchedule To ensure that a Cluster resource is scheduled on a node with a postgres taint, you must correctly configure the .spec.affinity.tolerations stanza in your manifests. Here\u2019s an example: spec: # <snip> affinity: # <snip> tolerations: - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres operator: Exists effect: NoSchedule PostgreSQL architecture CloudNativePG supports clusters based on asynchronous and synchronous streaming replication to manage multiple hot standby replicas within the same Kubernetes cluster, with the following specifications: One primary, with optional multiple hot standby replicas for HA Available services for applications: -rw : applications connect only to the primary instance of the cluster -ro : applications connect only to hot standby replicas for read-only-workloads (optional) -r : applications connect to any of the instances for read-only workloads (optional) Shared-nothing architecture recommended for better resilience of the PostgreSQL cluster: PostgreSQL instances should reside on different Kubernetes worker nodes and share only the network - as a result, instances should not share the storage and preferably use local volumes attached to the node they run on PostgreSQL instances should reside in different availability zones within the same Kubernetes cluster / region Important You can configure the above services through the managed.services section in the Cluster configuration. This can be done by reducing the number of services and selecting the type (default is ClusterIP ). For more details, please refer to the \"Service Management\" section below. The below diagram provides a simplistic view of the recommended shared-nothing architecture for a PostgreSQL cluster spanning across 3 different availability zones, running on separate nodes, each with dedicated local storage for PostgreSQL data. CloudNativePG automatically takes care of updating the above services if the topology of the cluster changes. For example, in case of failover, it automatically updates the -rw service to point to the promoted primary, making sure that traffic from the applications is seamlessly redirected. Replication Please refer to the \"Replication\" section for more information about how CloudNativePG relies on PostgreSQL replication, including synchronous settings. Connecting from an application Please refer to the \"Connecting from an application\" section for information about how to connect to CloudNativePG from a stateless application within the same Kubernetes cluster. Connection Pooling Please refer to the \"Connection Pooling\" section for information about how to take advantage of PgBouncer as a connection pooler, and create an access layer between your applications and the PostgreSQL clusters. Read-write workloads Applications can decide to connect to the PostgreSQL instance elected as current primary by the Kubernetes operator, as depicted in the following diagram: Applications can use the -rw suffix service. In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the primary, for High Availability purposes CloudNativePG will trigger a failover, pointing the -rw service to another instance of the cluster. Read-only workloads Important Applications must be aware of the limitations that Hot Standby presents and familiar with the way PostgreSQL operates when dealing with these workloads. Applications can access hot standby replicas through the -ro service made available by the operator. This service enables the application to offload read-only queries from the primary node. The following diagram shows the architecture: Applications can also access any PostgreSQL instance through the -r service. Deployments across Kubernetes clusters Info CloudNativePG supports deploying PostgreSQL across multiple Kubernetes clusters through a feature that allows you to define a distributed PostgreSQL topology using replica clusters, as described in this section. In a distributed PostgreSQL cluster there can only be a single PostgreSQL instance acting as a primary at all times. This means that applications can only write inside a single Kubernetes cluster, at any time. However, for business continuity objectives it is fundamental to: reduce global recovery point objectives ( RPO ) by storing PostgreSQL backup data in multiple locations, regions and possibly using different providers (Disaster Recovery) reduce global recovery time objectives ( RTO ) by taking advantage of PostgreSQL replication beyond the primary Kubernetes cluster (High Availability) In order to address the above concerns, CloudNativePG introduces the concept of a PostgreSQL Topology that is distributed across different Kubernetes clusters and is made up of a primary PostgreSQL cluster and one or more PostgreSQL replica clusters. This feature is called distributed PostgreSQL topology with replica clusters , and it enables multi-cluster deployments in private, public, hybrid, and multi-cloud contexts. A replica cluster is a separate Cluster resource that is in continuous recovery, replicating from another source, either via WAL shipping from a WAL archive or via streaming replication from a primary or a standby (cascading). The diagram below depicts a PostgreSQL cluster spanning over two different Kubernetes clusters, where the primary cluster is in the first Kubernetes cluster and the replica cluster is in the second. The second Kubernetes cluster acts as the company's disaster recovery cluster, ready to be activated in case of disaster and unavailability of the first one. A replica cluster can have the same architecture as the primary cluster. Instead of a primary instance, a replica cluster has a designated primary instance, which is a standby server with an arbitrary number of cascading standby servers in streaming replication (symmetric architecture). The designated primary can be promoted at any time, transforming the replica cluster into a primary cluster capable of accepting write connections. This is typically triggered by: Human decision: You choose to make the other PostgreSQL cluster (or the entire Kubernetes cluster) the primary. To avoid data loss and ensure that the former primary can follow without being re-cloned (especially with large data sets), you first demote the current primary, then promote the designated primary using the API provided by CloudNativePG. Unexpected failure: If the entire Kubernetes cluster fails, you might experience data loss, but you need to fail over to the other Kubernetes cluster by promoting the PostgreSQL replica cluster. Warning CloudNativePG cannot perform any cross-cluster automated failover, as it does not have authority beyond a single Kubernetes cluster. Such operations must be performed manually or delegated to a multi-cluster/federated cluster-aware authority. Important CloudNativePG allows you to control the distributed topology via declarative configuration, enabling you to automate these procedures as part of your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) process, including GitOps. In the example above, the designated primary receives WAL updates via streaming replication ( primary_conninfo ). As a fallback, it can retrieve WAL segments from an object store using file-based WAL shipping\u2014for instance, with the Barman Cloud plugin through restore_command and barman-cloud-wal-restore . CloudNativePG allows you to define topologies with multiple replica clusters. You can also define replica clusters with a lower number of replicas, and then increase this number when the cluster is promoted to primary. Replica clusters Please refer to the \"Replica Clusters\" section for more detailed information on how physical replica clusters operate and how to define a distributed topology with read-only clusters across different Kubernetes clusters.

For details, please refer to \"Running in multiple zones\" . This means that each data center is active at any time and can run workloads simultaneously.

This scenario is typical of Kubernetes services managed by Cloud Providers. Such an architecture enables the CloudNativePG operator to control the full lifecycle of a Cluster resource across the zones within a single Kubernetes cluster, by treating all the availability zones as active: this includes, among other operations, scheduling the workloads in a declarative manner (based on affinity rules, tolerations and node selectors), automated failover, self-healing, and updates. All will work seamlessly across the zones in a single Kubernetes cluster. Please refer to the \"PostgreSQL architecture\" section below for details on how you can design your PostgreSQL clusters within the same Kubernetes cluster through shared-nothing deployments at the storage, worker node, and availability zone levels. Additionally, you can leverage Kubernetes clusters to deploy distributed PostgreSQL topologies hosting \"passive\" PostgreSQL replica clusters in different regions and managing them via declarative configuration. This setup is ideal for disaster recovery (DR), read-only operations, or cross-region availability. Important Each operator deployment can only manage operations within its local Kubernetes cluster. For operations across Kubernetes clusters, such as controlled switchover or unexpected failover, coordination must be handled manually (through GitOps, for example) or by using a higher-level cluster management tool.","title":"Multi-availability zone Kubernetes clusters"},{"location":"architecture/#single-availability-zone-kubernetes-clusters","text":"If your Kubernetes cluster has only one availability zone, CloudNativePG still provides you with a lot of features to improve HA and DR outcomes for your PostgreSQL databases, pushing the single point of failure (SPoF) to the level of the zone as much as possible - i.e. the zone must have an outage before your CloudNativePG clusters suffer a failure. This scenario is typical of self-managed on-premise Kubernetes clusters, where only one data center is available. Single availability zone Kubernetes clusters are the only viable option when only two data centers are available within reach of a low-latency connection (typically in the same metropolitan area). Having only two zones prevents the creation of a multi-availability zone Kubernetes cluster, which requires a minimum of three zones. As a result, users must create two separate Kubernetes clusters in an active/passive configuration, with the second cluster primarily used for Disaster Recovery (see the replica cluster feature ). Hint If you are at en early stage of your Kubernetes journey, please share this document with your infrastructure team. The two data centers setup might be simply the result of a \"lift-and-shift\" transition to Kubernetes from a traditional bare-metal or VM based infrastructure, and the benefits that Kubernetes offers in a 3+ zone scenario might not have been known, or addressed at the time the infrastructure architecture was designed. Ultimately, a third physical location connected to the other two might represent a valid option to consider for organization, as it reduces the overall costs of the infrastructure by moving the day-to-day complexity from the application level down to the physical infrastructure level. Please refer to the \"PostgreSQL architecture\" section below for details on how you can design your PostgreSQL clusters within your single availability zone Kubernetes cluster through shared-nothing deployments at the storage and worker node levels only. For HA, in such a scenario it becomes even more important that the PostgreSQL instances be located on different worker nodes and do not share the same storage. For DR, you can push the SPoF above the single zone, by using additional Kubernetes clusters to define a distributed topology hosting \"passive\" PostgreSQL replica clusters . As with other Kubernetes workloads in this scenario, promotion of a Kubernetes cluster as primary must be done manually. Through the replica cluster feature , you can define a distributed PostgreSQL topology and coordinate a controlled switchover between data centers by first demoting the primary cluster and then promoting the replica cluster, without the need to re-clone the former primary. While failover is now fully declarative, automated failover across Kubernetes clusters is not within CloudNativePG's scope, as the operator can only function within a single Kubernetes cluster.

A Kubernetes worker node dedicated to running PostgreSQL workloads is referred to as a Postgres node or postgres node. This approach ensures optimal performance and resource allocation for your database operations. Hint As a general rule of thumb, deploy Postgres nodes in multiples of three\u2014ideally with one node per availability zone. Three nodes is an optimal number because it ensures that a PostgreSQL cluster with three instances (one primary and two standby replicas) is distributed across different nodes, enhancing fault tolerance and availability. In Kubernetes, this can be achieved using node labels and taints in a declarative manner, aligning with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices: labels ensure that a node is capable of running postgres workloads, while taints help prevent any non- postgres workloads from being scheduled on that node. Important This methodology is the most straightforward way to ensure that PostgreSQL workloads are isolated from other workloads in terms of both computing resources and, when using locally attached disks, storage.

In a distributed PostgreSQL cluster there can only be a single PostgreSQL instance acting as a primary at all times. This means that applications can only write inside a single Kubernetes cluster, at any time. However, for business continuity objectives it is fundamental to: reduce global recovery point objectives ( RPO ) by storing PostgreSQL backup data in multiple locations, regions and possibly using different providers (Disaster Recovery) reduce global recovery time objectives ( RTO ) by taking advantage of PostgreSQL replication beyond the primary Kubernetes cluster (High Availability) In order to address the above concerns, CloudNativePG introduces the concept of a PostgreSQL Topology that is distributed across different Kubernetes clusters and is made up of a primary PostgreSQL cluster and one or more PostgreSQL replica clusters. This feature is called distributed PostgreSQL topology with replica clusters , and it enables multi-cluster deployments in private, public, hybrid, and multi-cloud contexts. A replica cluster is a separate Cluster resource that is in continuous recovery, replicating from another source, either via WAL shipping from a WAL archive or via streaming replication from a primary or a standby (cascading). The diagram below depicts a PostgreSQL cluster spanning over two different Kubernetes clusters, where the primary cluster is in the first Kubernetes cluster and the replica cluster is in the second. The second Kubernetes cluster acts as the company's disaster recovery cluster, ready to be activated in case of disaster and unavailability of the first one. A replica cluster can have the same architecture as the primary cluster. Instead of a primary instance, a replica cluster has a designated primary instance, which is a standby server with an arbitrary number of cascading standby servers in streaming replication (symmetric architecture). The designated primary can be promoted at any time, transforming the replica cluster into a primary cluster capable of accepting write connections. This is typically triggered by: Human decision: You choose to make the other PostgreSQL cluster (or the entire Kubernetes cluster) the primary. To avoid data loss and ensure that the former primary can follow without being re-cloned (especially with large data sets), you first demote the current primary, then promote the designated primary using the API provided by CloudNativePG. Unexpected failure: If the entire Kubernetes cluster fails, you might experience data loss, but you need to fail over to the other Kubernetes cluster by promoting the PostgreSQL replica cluster. Warning CloudNativePG cannot perform any cross-cluster automated failover, as it does not have authority beyond a single Kubernetes cluster. Such operations must be performed manually or delegated to a multi-cluster/federated cluster-aware authority. Important CloudNativePG allows you to control the distributed topology via declarative configuration, enabling you to automate these procedures as part of your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) process, including GitOps. In the example above, the designated primary receives WAL updates via streaming replication ( primary_conninfo ). As a fallback, it can retrieve WAL segments from an object store using file-based WAL shipping\u2014for instance, with the Barman Cloud plugin through restore_command and barman-cloud-wal-restore . CloudNativePG allows you to define topologies with multiple replica clusters. You can also define replica clusters with a lower number of replicas, and then increase this number when the cluster is promoted to primary. Replica clusters Please refer to the \"Replica Clusters\" section for more detailed information on how physical replica clusters operate and how to define a distributed topology with read-only clusters across different Kubernetes clusters. This approach can significantly enhance your global disaster recovery and high availability (HA) strategy.","title":"Deployments across Kubernetes clusters"},{"location":"backup/","text":"Backup Warning With the deprecation of native Barman Cloud support in CloudNativePG in favor of the Barman Cloud Plugin, this page\u2014and the backup and recovery documentation\u2014may undergo changes before the official release of version 1.26.0. PostgreSQL natively provides first class backup and recovery capabilities based on file system level (physical) copy. These have been successfully used for more than 15 years in mission critical production databases, helping organizations all over the world achieve their disaster recovery goals with Postgres. Note There's another way to backup databases in PostgreSQL, through the pg_dump utility - which relies on logical backups instead of physical ones. However, logical backups are not suitable for business continuity use cases and as such are not covered by CloudNativePG (yet, at least). If you want to use the pg_dump utility, let yourself be inspired by the \"Troubleshooting / Emergency backup\" section . In CloudNativePG, the backup infrastructure for each PostgreSQL cluster is made up of the following resources: WAL archive : a location containing the WAL files (transactional logs) that are continuously written by Postgres and archived for data durability Physical base backups : a copy of all the files that PostgreSQL uses to store the data in the database (primarily the PGDATA and any tablespace) The WAL archive can only be stored on object stores at the moment. On the other hand, CloudNativePG supports two ways to store physical base backups: on object stores , as tarballs - optionally compressed: Using the Barman Cloud plugin Natively via .spec.backup.barmanObjectStore ( deprecated, to be removed in CloudNativePG 1.28 ) on Kubernetes Volume Snapshots , if supported by the underlying storage class Important Before choosing your backup strategy with CloudNativePG, it is important that you take some time to familiarize with some basic concepts, like WAL archive, hot and cold backups. Important Please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation for a list of all the supported Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers that provide snapshotting capabilities. WAL archive The WAL archive in PostgreSQL is at the heart of continuous backup , and it is fundamental for the following reasons: Hot backups : the possibility to take physical base backups from any instance in the Postgres cluster (either primary or standby) without shutting down the server; they are also known as online backups Point in Time recovery (PITR): to possibility to recover at any point in time from the first available base backup in your system Warning WAL archive alone is useless. Without a physical base backup, you cannot restore a PostgreSQL cluster. In general, the presence of a WAL archive enhances the resilience of a PostgreSQL cluster, allowing each instance to fetch any required WAL file from the archive if needed (normally the WAL archive has higher retention periods than any Postgres instance that normally recycles those files). This use case can also be extended to replica clusters , as they can simply rely on the WAL archive to synchronize across long distances, extending disaster recovery goals across different regions. When you configure a WAL archive , CloudNativePG provides out-of-the-box an RPO <= 5 minutes for disaster recovery, even across regions. Important Our recommendation is to always setup the WAL archive in production. There are known use cases - normally involving staging and development environments - where none of the above benefits are needed and the WAL archive is not necessary. RPO in this case can be any value, such as 24 hours (daily backups) or infinite (no backup at all). Cold and Hot backups Hot backups have already been defined in the previous section. They require the presence of a WAL archive and they are the norm in any modern database management system. Cold backups , also known as offline backups, are instead physical base backups taken when the PostgreSQL instance (standby or primary) is shut down. They are consistent per definition and they represent a snapshot of the database at the time it was shut down. As a result, PostgreSQL instances can be restarted from a cold backup without the need of a WAL archive, even though they can take advantage of it, if available (with all the benefits on the recovery side highlighted in the previous section). In those situations with a higher RPO (for example, 1 hour or 24 hours), and shorter retention periods, cold backups represent a viable option to be considered for your disaster recovery plans. Object stores or volume snapshots: which one to use? In CloudNativePG, object store based backups: always require the WAL archive support hot backup only don't support incremental copy don't support differential copy VolumeSnapshots instead: don't require the WAL archive, although in production it is always recommended support incremental copy, depending on the underlying storage classes support differential copy, depending on the underlying storage classes also support cold backup Which one to use depends on your specific requirements and environment, including: availability of a viable object store solution in your Kubernetes cluster availability of a trusted storage class that supports volume snapshots size of the database: with object stores, the larger your database, the longer backup and, most importantly, recovery procedures take (the latter impacts RTO ); in presence of Very Large Databases (VLDB), the general advice is to rely on Volume Snapshots as, thanks to copy-on-write, they provide faster recovery data mobility and possibility to store or relay backup files on a secondary location in a different region, or any subsequent one other factors, mostly based on the confidence and familiarity with the underlying storage solutions The summary table below highlights some of the main differences between the two available methods for storing physical base backups.

They are managed by the ScheduledBackup resource. Info Please refer to ScheduledBackupSpec in the API reference for a full list of options. The schedule field allows you to define a six-term cron schedule specification, which includes seconds, as expressed in the Go cron package format . Warning Beware that this format accepts also the seconds field, and it is different from the crontab format in Unix/Linux systems. This is an example of a scheduled backup: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: ScheduledBackup metadata: name: backup-example spec: schedule: \"0 0 0 * * *\" backupOwnerReference: self cluster: name: pg-backup The above example will schedule a backup every day at midnight because the schedule specifies zero for the second, minute, and hour, while specifying wildcard, meaning all, for day of the month, month, and day of the week. In Kubernetes CronJobs, the equivalent expression is 0 0 * * * because seconds are not included. Hint Backup frequency might impact your recovery time objective ( RTO ) after a disaster which requires a full or Point-In-Time recovery operation. Our advice is that you regularly test your backups by recovering them, and then measuring the time it takes to recover from scratch so that you can refine your RTO predictability. Recovery time is influenced by the size of the base backup and the amount of WAL files that need to be fetched from the archive and replayed during recovery (remember that WAL archiving is what enables continuous backup in PostgreSQL!). Based on our experience, a weekly base backup is more than enough for most cases - while it is extremely rare to schedule backups more frequently than once a day. You can choose whether to schedule a backup on a defined object store or a volume snapshot via the .spec.method attribute, by default set to barmanObjectStore . If you have properly defined volume snapshots in the backup stanza of the cluster, you can set method: volumeSnapshot to start scheduling base backups on volume snapshots. ScheduledBackups can be suspended, if needed, by setting .spec.suspend: true . This will stop any new backup from being scheduled until the option is removed or set back to false . In case you want to issue a backup as soon as the ScheduledBackup resource is created you can set .spec.immediate: true . Note .spec.backupOwnerReference indicates which ownerReference should be put inside the created backup resources. none: no owner reference for created backup objects (same behavior as before the field was introduced) self: sets the Scheduled backup object as owner of the backup cluster: set the cluster as owner of the backup On-demand backups Info Please refer to BackupSpec in the API reference for a full list of options. To request a new backup, you need to create a new Backup resource like the following one: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Backup metadata: name: backup-example spec: method: barmanObjectStore cluster: name: pg-backup In this case, the operator will start to orchestrate the cluster to take the required backup on an object store, using barman-cloud-backup .

The secrets are supposed to be backed up as part of the standard backup procedures for the Kubernetes cluster. Backup from a standby Taking a base backup requires to scrape the whole data content of the PostgreSQL instance on disk, possibly resulting in I/O contention with the actual workload of the database. For this reason, CloudNativePG allows you to take advantage of a feature which is directly available in PostgreSQL: backup from a standby . By default, backups will run on the most aligned replica of a Cluster . If no replicas are available, backups will run on the primary instance. Info Although the standby might not always be up to date with the primary, in the time continuum from the first available backup to the last archived WAL this is normally irrelevant. The base backup indeed represents the starting point from which to begin a recovery operation, including PITR. Similarly to what happens with pg_basebackup , when backing up from an online standby we do not force a switch of the WAL on the primary. This might produce unexpected results in the short term (before archive_timeout kicks in) in deployments with low write activity. If you prefer to always run backups on the primary, you can set the backup target to primary as outlined in the example below: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: [...] spec: backup: target: \"primary\" Warning Beware of setting the target to primary when performing a cold backup with volume snapshots, as this will shut down the primary for the time needed to take the snapshot, impacting write operations. This also applies to taking a cold backup in a single-instance cluster, even if you did not explicitly set the primary as the target. When the backup target is set to prefer-standby , such policy will ensure backups are run on the most up-to-date available secondary instance, or if no other instance is available, on the primary instance. By default, when not otherwise specified, target is automatically set to take backups from a standby. The backup target specified in the Cluster can be overridden in the Backup and ScheduledBackup types, like in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Backup metadata: [...] spec: cluster: name: [...] target: \"primary\" In the previous example, CloudNativePG will invariably choose the primary instance even if the Cluster is set to prefer replicas.","title":"Backup"},{"location":"backup/#backup","text":"Warning With the deprecation of native Barman Cloud support in CloudNativePG in favor of the Barman Cloud Plugin, this page\u2014and the backup and recovery documentation\u2014may undergo changes before the official release of version 1.26.0.

You can choose whether to schedule a backup on a defined object store or a volume snapshot via the .spec.method attribute, by default set to barmanObjectStore . If you have properly defined volume snapshots in the backup stanza of the cluster, you can set method: volumeSnapshot to start scheduling base backups on volume snapshots. ScheduledBackups can be suspended, if needed, by setting .spec.suspend: true . This will stop any new backup from being scheduled until the option is removed or set back to false . In case you want to issue a backup as soon as the ScheduledBackup resource is created you can set .spec.immediate: true .

For this reason, CloudNativePG allows you to take advantage of a feature which is directly available in PostgreSQL: backup from a standby . By default, backups will run on the most aligned replica of a Cluster . If no replicas are available, backups will run on the primary instance. Info Although the standby might not always be up to date with the primary, in the time continuum from the first available backup to the last archived WAL this is normally irrelevant. The base backup indeed represents the starting point from which to begin a recovery operation, including PITR. Similarly to what happens with pg_basebackup , when backing up from an online standby we do not force a switch of the WAL on the primary. This might produce unexpected results in the short term (before archive_timeout kicks in) in deployments with low write activity. If you prefer to always run backups on the primary, you can set the backup target to primary as outlined in the example below: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: [...] spec: backup: target: \"primary\" Warning Beware of setting the target to primary when performing a cold backup with volume snapshots, as this will shut down the primary for the time needed to take the snapshot, impacting write operations. This also applies to taking a cold backup in a single-instance cluster, even if you did not explicitly set the primary as the target. When the backup target is set to prefer-standby , such policy will ensure backups are run on the most up-to-date available secondary instance, or if no other instance is available, on the primary instance. By default, when not otherwise specified, target is automatically set to take backups from a standby. The backup target specified in the Cluster can be overridden in the Backup and ScheduledBackup types, like in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Backup metadata: [...] spec: cluster: name: [...] target: \"primary\" In the previous example, CloudNativePG will invariably choose the primary instance even if the Cluster is set to prefer replicas.","title":"Backup from a standby"},{"location":"backup_barmanobjectstore/","text":"Backup on object stores Warning With the deprecation of native Barman Cloud support in CloudNativePG in favor of the Barman Cloud Plugin, this page\u2014and the backup and recovery documentation\u2014may undergo changes before the official release of version 1.26.0. CloudNativePG natively supports online/hot backup of PostgreSQL clusters through continuous physical backup and WAL archiving on an object store. This means that the database is always up (no downtime required) and that Point In Time Recovery is available. The operator can orchestrate a continuous backup infrastructure that is based on the Barman Cloud tool.

For example, you can define your backups with a retention policy of 30 days as follows: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: \"<destination path here>\" s3Credentials: accessKeyId: name: aws-creds key: ACCESS_KEY_ID secretAccessKey: name: aws-creds key: ACCESS_SECRET_KEY retentionPolicy: \"30d\" There's more ... The recovery window retention policy is focused on the concept of Point of Recoverability ( PoR ), a moving point in time determined by current time - recovery window . The first valid backup is the first available backup before PoR (in reverse chronological order). CloudNativePG must ensure that we can recover the cluster at any point in time between PoR and the latest successfully archived WAL file, starting from the first valid backup. Base backups that are older than the first valid backup will be marked as obsolete and permanently removed after the next backup is completed. Compression algorithms CloudNativePG by default archives backups and WAL files in an uncompressed fashion. However, it also supports the following compression algorithms via barman-cloud-backup (for backups) and barman-cloud-wal-archive (for WAL files): bzip2 gzip lz4 snappy xz zstd The compression settings for backups and WALs are independent. See the DataBackupConfiguration and WALBackupConfiguration sections in the barman-cloud API reference.

CloudNativePG is one of the first known cases of database operators that directly leverages the Kubernetes native Volume Snapshot API for both backup and recovery operations, in an entirely declarative way. About standard Volume Snapshots Volume snapshotting was first introduced in Kubernetes 1.12 (2018) as alpha , promoted to beta in 1.17 (2019) , and moved to GA in 1.20 (2020) . It\u2019s now stable, widely available, and standard, providing 3 custom resource definitions: VolumeSnapshot , VolumeSnapshotContent and VolumeSnapshotClass . This Kubernetes feature defines a generic interface for: the creation of a new volume snapshot, starting from a PVC the deletion of an existing snapshot the creation of a new volume from a snapshot Kubernetes delegates the actual implementation to the underlying CSI drivers (not all of them support volume snapshots). Normally, storage classes that provide volume snapshotting support incremental and differential block level backup in a transparent way for the application , which can delegate the complexity and the independent management down the stack, including cross-cluster availability of the snapshots. Requirements For Volume Snapshots to work with a CloudNativePG cluster, you need to ensure that each storage class used to dynamically provision the PostgreSQL volumes (namely, storage and walStorage sections) support volume snapshots. Given that instructions vary from storage class to storage class, please refer to the documentation of the specific storage class and related CSI drivers you have deployed in your Kubernetes system. Normally, it is the VolumeSnapshotClass that is responsible to ensure that snapshots can be taken from persistent volumes of a given storage class, and managed as VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent resources. Important It is your responsibility to verify with the third party vendor that volume snapshots are supported. CloudNativePG only interacts with the Kubernetes API on this matter and we cannot support issues at the storage level for each specific CSI driver. How to configure Volume Snapshot backups CloudNativePG allows you to configure a given Postgres cluster for Volume Snapshot backups through the backup.volumeSnapshot stanza. Info Please refer to VolumeSnapshotConfiguration in the API reference for a full list of options. A generic example with volume snapshots (assuming that PGDATA and WALs share the same storage class) is the following: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: snapshot-cluster spec: instances: 3 storage: storageClass: @STORAGE_CLASS@ size: 10Gi walStorage: storageClass: @STORAGE_CLASS@ size: 10Gi backup: # Volume snapshot backups volumeSnapshot: className: @VOLUME_SNAPSHOT_CLASS_NAME@ # WAL archive barmanObjectStore: # ... As you can see, the backup section contains both the volumeSnapshot stanza (controlling physical base backups on volume snapshots) and the barmanObjectStore one (controlling the WAL archive ). Info Once you have defined the barmanObjectStore , you can decide to use both volume snapshot and object store backup strategies simultaneously to take physical backups. The volumeSnapshot.className option allows you to reference the default VolumeSnapshotClass object used for all the storage volumes you have defined in your PostgreSQL cluster. Info In case you are using a different storage class for PGDATA and WAL files, you can specify a separate VolumeSnapshotClass for that volume through the walClassName option (which defaults to the same value as className ). Once a cluster is defined for volume snapshot backups, you need to define a ScheduledBackup resource that requests such backups on a periodic basis. Hot and cold backups By default, CloudNativePG requests an online/hot backup on volume snapshots, using the PostgreSQL defaults of the low-level API for base backups : it doesn't request an immediate checkpoint when starting the backup procedure it waits for the WAL archiver to archive the last segment of the backup when terminating the backup procedure Important The default values are suitable for most production environments. Hot backups are consistent and can be used to perform snapshot recovery, as we ensure WAL retention from the start of the backup through a temporary replication slot. However, our recommendation is to rely on cold backups for that purpose. You can explicitly change the default behavior through the following options in the .spec.backup.volumeSnapshot stanza of the Cluster resource: online : accepting true (default) or false as a value onlineConfiguration.immediateCheckpoint : whether you want to request an immediate checkpoint before you start the backup procedure or not; technically, it corresponds to the fast argument you pass to the pg_backup_start / pg_start_backup() function in PostgreSQL, accepting true (default) or false onlineConfiguration.waitForArchive : whether you want to wait for the archiver to process the last segment of the backup or not; technically, it corresponds to the wait_for_archive argument you pass to the pg_backup_stop / pg_stop_backup() function in PostgreSQL, accepting true (default) or false If you want to change the default behavior of your Postgres cluster to take cold backups by default, all you need to do is add the online: false option to your manifest, as follows: # ... backup: volumeSnapshot: online: false # ... If you are instead requesting an immediate checkpoint as the default behavior, you can add this section: # ... backup: volumeSnapshot: online: true onlineConfiguration: immediateCheckpoint: true # ... Overriding the default behavior You can change the default behavior defined in the cluster resource by setting different values for online and, if needed, onlineConfiguration in the Backup or ScheduledBackup objects. For example, in case you want to issue an on-demand cold backup, you can create a Backup object with .spec.online: false : apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Backup metadata: name: snapshot-cluster-cold-backup-example spec: cluster: name: snapshot-cluster method: volumeSnapshot online: false Similarly, for the ScheduledBackup: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: ScheduledBackup metadata: name: snapshot-cluster-cold-backup-example spec: schedule: \"0 0 0 * * *\" backupOwnerReference: self cluster: name: snapshot-cluster method: volumeSnapshot online: false Persistence of volume snapshot objects By default, VolumeSnapshot objects created by CloudNativePG are retained after deleting the Backup object that originated them, or the Cluster they refer to. Such behavior is controlled by the .spec.backup.volumeSnapshot.snapshotOwnerReference option which accepts the following values: none : no ownership is set, meaning that VolumeSnapshot objects persist after the Backup and/or the Cluster resources are removed backup : the VolumeSnapshot object is owned by the Backup resource that originated it, and when the backup object is removed, the volume snapshot is also removed cluster : the VolumeSnapshot object is owned by the Cluster resource that is backed up, and when the Postgres cluster is removed, the volume snapshot is also removed In case a VolumeSnapshot is deleted, the deletionPolicy specified in the VolumeSnapshotContent is evaluated: if set to Retain , the VolumeSnapshotContent object is kept if set to Delete , the VolumeSnapshotContent object is removed as well Warning VolumeSnapshotContent objects do not keep all the information regarding the backup and the cluster they refer to (like the annotations and labels that are contained in the VolumeSnapshot object). Although possible, restoring from just this kind of object might not be straightforward. For this reason, our recommendation is to always backup the VolumeSnapshot definitions, even using a Kubernetes level data protection solution. The value in VolumeSnapshotContent is determined by the deletionPolicy set in the corresponding VolumeSnapshotClass definition, which is referenced in the .spec.backup.volumeSnapshot.className option. Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation on Volume Snapshot Classes for details on this standard behavior. Backup Volume Snapshot Deadlines CloudNativePG supports backups using the volume snapshot method. In some environments, volume snapshots may encounter temporary issues that can be retried. The backup.cnpg.io/volumeSnapshotDeadline annotation defines how long CloudNativePG should continue retrying recoverable errors before marking the backup as failed. You can add the backup.cnpg.io/volumeSnapshotDeadline annotation to both Backup and ScheduledBackup resources. For ScheduledBackup resources, this annotation is automatically inherited by any Backup resources created from the schedule. If not specified, the default retry deadline is 10 minutes . Error Handling When a retryable error occurs during a volume snapshot operation: CloudNativePG records the time of the first error. The system retries the operation every 10 seconds . If the error persists beyond the specified deadline (or the default 10 minutes), the backup is marked as failed . Retryable Errors CloudNativePG treats the following types of errors as retryable: Server timeout errors (HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504) Conflicts (optimistic locking errors) Internal errors Context deadline exceeded errors Timeout errors from the CSI snapshot controller Examples You can add the annotation to a ScheduledBackup resource as follows: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: ScheduledBackup metadata: name: daily-backup-schedule annotations: backup.cnpg.io/volumeSnapshotDeadline: \"20\" spec: schedule: \"0 0 * * *\" backupOwnerReference: self method: volumeSnapshot # other configuration... When you define a ScheduledBackup with the annotation, any Backup resources created from this schedule automatically inherit the specified timeout value. In the following example, all backups created from the schedule will have a 30-minute timeout for retrying recoverable snapshot errors. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: ScheduledBackup metadata: name: weekly-backup annotations: backup.cnpg.io/volumeSnapshotDeadline: \"30\" spec: schedule: \"0 0 * * 0\" # Weekly backup on Sunday method: volumeSnapshot cluster: name: my-postgresql-cluster Alternatively, you can add the annotation directly to a Backup Resource: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Backup metadata: name: my-backup annotations: backup.cnpg.io/volumeSnapshotDeadline: \"15\" spec: method: volumeSnapshot # other backup configuration... Example of Volume Snapshot Backup The following example shows how to configure volume snapshot base backups on an EKS cluster on AWS using the ebs-sc storage class and the csi-aws-vsc volume snapshot class. Important If you are interested in testing the example, please read \"Volume Snapshots\" for the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) CSI driver for detailed instructions on the installation process for the storage class and the snapshot class. The following manifest creates a Cluster that is ready to be used for volume snapshots and that stores the WAL archive in a S3 bucket via IAM role for the Service Account (IRSA, see AWS S3 ): apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: hendrix spec: instances: 3 storage: storageClass: ebs-sc size: 10Gi walStorage: storageClass: ebs-sc size: 10Gi backup: volumeSnapshot: className: csi-aws-vsc barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://@BUCKET_NAME@/ s3Credentials: inheritFromIAMRole: true wal: compression: gzip maxParallel: 2 serviceAccountTemplate: metadata: annotations: eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: \"@ARN@\" --- apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: ScheduledBackup metadata: name: hendrix-vs-backup spec: cluster: name: hendrix method: volumeSnapshot schedule: '0 0 0 * * *' backupOwnerReference: cluster immediate: true The last resource defines daily volume snapshot backups at midnight, requesting one immediately after the cluster is created.","title":"Backup on volume snapshots"},{"location":"backup_volumesnapshot/#backup-on-volume-snapshots","text":"Warning As noted in the backup document , a cold snapshot explicitly set to target the primary will result in the primary being fenced for the duration of the backup, rendering the cluster read-only during that For safety, in a cluster already containing fenced instances, a cold snapshot is rejected.

As you can see, the backup section contains both the volumeSnapshot stanza (controlling physical base backups on volume snapshots) and the barmanObjectStore one (controlling the WAL archive ). Info Once you have defined the barmanObjectStore , you can decide to use both volume snapshot and object store backup strategies simultaneously to take physical backups. The volumeSnapshot.className option allows you to reference the default VolumeSnapshotClass object used for all the storage volumes you have defined in your PostgreSQL cluster. Info In case you are using a different storage class for PGDATA and WAL files, you can specify a separate VolumeSnapshotClass for that volume through the walClassName option (which defaults to the same value as className ). Once a cluster is defined for volume snapshot backups, you need to define a ScheduledBackup resource that requests such backups on a periodic basis.","title":"How to configure Volume Snapshot backups"},{"location":"backup_volumesnapshot/#hot-and-cold-backups","text":"By default, CloudNativePG requests an online/hot backup on volume snapshots, using the PostgreSQL defaults of the low-level API for base backups : it doesn't request an immediate checkpoint when starting the backup procedure it waits for the WAL archiver to archive the last segment of the backup when terminating the backup procedure Important The default values are suitable for most production environments. Hot backups are consistent and can be used to perform snapshot recovery, as we ensure WAL retention from the start of the backup through a temporary replication slot. However, our recommendation is to rely on cold backups for that purpose. You can explicitly change the default behavior through the following options in the .spec.backup.volumeSnapshot stanza of the Cluster resource: online : accepting true (default) or false as a value onlineConfiguration.immediateCheckpoint : whether you want to request an immediate checkpoint before you start the backup procedure or not; technically, it corresponds to the fast argument you pass to the pg_backup_start / pg_start_backup() function in PostgreSQL, accepting true (default) or false onlineConfiguration.waitForArchive : whether you want to wait for the archiver to process the last segment of the backup or not; technically, it corresponds to the wait_for_archive argument you pass to the pg_backup_stop / pg_stop_backup() function in PostgreSQL, accepting true (default) or false If you want to change the default behavior of your Postgres cluster to take cold backups by default, all you need to do is add the online: false option to your manifest, as follows: # ... backup: volumeSnapshot: online: false # ...

Although possible, restoring from just this kind of object might not be straightforward. For this reason, our recommendation is to always backup the VolumeSnapshot definitions, even using a Kubernetes level data protection solution.

Kubernetes terminology Node A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes, either virtual or physical, where all services necessary to run pods are managed by the control plane node(s). Postgres Node A Postgres node is a Kubernetes worker node dedicated to running PostgreSQL workloads. This is achieved by applying the node-role.kubernetes.io label and taint, as proposed by CloudNativePG . It is also referred to as a postgres node. Pod A pod is the smallest computing unit that can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster and is composed of one or more containers that share network and storage. Service A service is an abstraction that exposes as a network service an application that runs on a group of pods and standardizes important features such as service discovery across applications, load balancing, failover, and so on. Secret A secret is an object that is designed to store small amounts of sensitive data such as passwords, access keys, or tokens, and use them in pods. Storage Class A storage class allows an administrator to define the classes of storage in a cluster, including provisioner (such as AWS EBS), reclaim policies, mount options, volume expansion, and so on. Persistent Volume A persistent volume (PV) is a resource in a Kubernetes cluster that represents storage that has been either manually provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned by a storage class controller. A PV is associated with a pod using a persistent volume claim and its lifecycle is independent of any pod that uses it. Normally, a PV is a network volume, especially in the public cloud. A local persistent volume (LPV) is a persistent volume that exists only on the particular node where the pod that uses it is running. Persistent Volume Claim A persistent volume claim (PVC) represents a request for storage, which might include size, access mode, or a particular storage class. Similar to how a pod consumes node resources, a PVC consumes the resources of a PV. Namespace A namespace is a logical and isolated subset of a Kubernetes cluster and can be seen as a virtual cluster within the wider physical cluster. Namespaces allow administrators to create separated environments based on projects, departments, teams, and so on. RBAC Role Based Access Control (RBAC), also known as role-based security , is a method used in computer systems security to restrict access to the network and resources of a system to authorized users only. Kubernetes has a native API to control roles at the namespace and cluster level and associate them with specific resources and individuals. CRD A custom resource definition (CRD) is an extension of the Kubernetes API and allows developers to create new data types and objects, called custom resources . Operator An operator is a custom resource that automates those steps that are normally performed by a human operator when managing one or more applications or given services. An operator assists Kubernetes in making sure that the resource's defined state always matches the observed one. kubectl kubectl is the command-line tool used to manage a Kubernetes cluster. CloudNativePG requires a Kubernetes version supported by the community. Please refer to the \"Supported releases\" page for details. PostgreSQL terminology Instance A Postgres server process running and listening on a pair \"IP address(es)\" and \"TCP port\" (usually 5432). Primary A PostgreSQL instance that can accept both read and write operations. Replica A PostgreSQL instance replicating from the only primary instance in a cluster and is kept updated by reading a stream of Write-Ahead Log (WAL) records. A replica is also known as standby or secondary server. PostgreSQL relies on physical streaming replication (async/sync) and file-based log shipping (async). Hot Standby PostgreSQL feature that allows a replica to accept read-only workloads. Cluster To be intended as High Availability (HA) Cluster: a set of PostgreSQL instances made up by a single primary and an optional arbitrary number of replicas. Replica Cluster A CloudNativePG Cluster that is in continuous recovery mode from a selected PostgreSQL cluster, normally residing outside the Kubernetes cluster. It is a feature that enables multi-cluster deployments in private, public, hybrid, and multi-cloud contexts. Designated Primary A PostgreSQL standby instance in a replica cluster that is in continuous recovery from another PostgreSQL cluster and that is designated to become primary in case the replica cluster becomes primary. Superuser In PostgreSQL a superuser is any role with both LOGIN and SUPERUSER privileges. For security reasons, CloudNativePG performs administrative tasks by connecting to the postgres database as the postgres user via peer authentication over the local Unix Domain Socket. WAL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) is a standard method for ensuring data integrity in database management systems. PVC group A PVC group in CloudNativePG's terminology is a group of related PVCs belonging to the same PostgreSQL instance, namely the main volume containing the PGDATA ( storage ) and the volume for WALs ( walStorage ). RTO Acronym for \"recovery time objective\", the amount of time a system can be unavailable without adversely impacting the application. RPO Acronym for \"recovery point objective\", a calculation of the level of acceptable data loss following a disaster recovery scenario. Cloud terminology Region A region in the Cloud is an isolated and independent geographic area organized in availability zones . Zones within a region have very little round-trip network latency. Zone An availability zone in the Cloud (also known as zone ) is an area in a region where resources can be deployed. Usually, an availability zone corresponds to a data center or an isolated building of the same data center.

There are primarily two ways to bootstrap a new cluster: from scratch ( initdb ) from an existing PostgreSQL cluster, either directly ( pg_basebackup ) or indirectly through a physical base backup ( recovery ) The initdb bootstrap also provides the option to import one or more databases from an existing PostgreSQL cluster, even if it's outside Kubernetes or running a different major version of PostgreSQL. For more detailed information about this feature, please refer to the \"Importing Postgres databases\" section. Important Bootstrapping from an existing cluster enables the creation of a replica cluster \u2014an independent PostgreSQL cluster that remains in continuous recovery, stays synchronized with the source cluster, and accepts read-only connections. For more details, refer to the Replica Cluster section . Warning CloudNativePG requires both the postgres user and database to always exist. Using the local Unix Domain Socket, it needs to connect as the postgres user to the postgres database via peer authentication in order to perform administrative tasks on the cluster. DO NOT DELETE the postgres user or the postgres database!!! Info CloudNativePG is gradually introducing support for Kubernetes' native VolumeSnapshot API for both incremental and differential copy in backup and recovery operations - if supported by the underlying storage classes. Please see \"Recovery from Volume Snapshot objects\" for details. The bootstrap section The bootstrap method can be defined in the bootstrap section of the cluster specification. CloudNativePG currently supports the following bootstrap methods: initdb : initialize a new PostgreSQL cluster (default) recovery : create a PostgreSQL cluster by restoring from a base backup of an existing cluster and, if needed, replaying all the available WAL files or up to a given point in time pg_basebackup : create a PostgreSQL cluster by cloning an existing one of the same major version using pg_basebackup through the streaming replication protocol. This method is particularly useful for migrating databases to CloudNativePG, although meeting all requirements can be challenging. Be sure to review the warnings in the pg_basebackup subsection carefully. In contrast to the initdb method, both recovery and pg_basebackup create a new cluster based on another one (either offline or online) and can be used to spin up replica clusters. They both rely on the definition of external clusters. Refer to the replica cluster section for more information. Given the amount of possible backup methods and combinations of backup storage that the CloudNativePG operator provides for recovery , please refer to the dedicated \"Recovery\" section for guidance on each method. API reference Please refer to the \"API reference for the bootstrap section for more information. The externalClusters section The externalClusters section of the cluster manifest can be used to configure access to one or more PostgreSQL clusters as sources . The primary use cases include: Importing Databases: Specify an external source to be utilized during the importation of databases via logical backup and restore, as part of the initdb bootstrap method. Cross-Region Replication: Define a cross-region PostgreSQL cluster employing physical replication, capable of extending across distinct Kubernetes clusters or traditional VM/bare-metal environments. Recovery from Physical Base Backup: Recover, fully or at a given Point-In-Time, a PostgreSQL cluster by referencing a physical base backup. Info Ongoing development will extend the functionality of externalClusters to accommodate additional use cases, such as logical replication and foreign servers in future releases. As far as bootstrapping is concerned, externalClusters can be used to define the source PostgreSQL cluster for either the pg_basebackup method or the recovery one. An external cluster needs to have: a name that identifies the external cluster, to be used as a reference via the source option at least one of the following: information about streaming connection information about the recovery object store , which is a Barman Cloud compatible object store that contains: the WAL archive (required for Point In Time Recovery) the catalog of physical base backups for the Postgres cluster Note A recovery object store is normally an AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage source that is managed by Barman Cloud. When only the streaming connection is defined, the source can be used for the pg_basebackup method. When only the recovery object store is defined, the source can be used for the recovery method. When both are defined, any of the two bootstrap methods can be chosen. The following table summarizes your options: Content of externalClusters pg_basebackup recovery Only streaming \u2713 Only object store \u2713 Streaming and object store \u2713 \u2713 Furthermore, in case of pg_basebackup or full recovery point in time, the cluster is eligible for replica cluster mode. This means that the cluster is continuously fed from the source, either via streaming, via WAL shipping through the PostgreSQL's restore_command , or any of the two. API reference Please refer to the \"API reference for the externalClusters section for more information. Password files Whenever a password is supplied within an externalClusters entry, CloudNativePG autonomously manages a PostgreSQL password file for it, residing at /controller/external/NAME/pgpass in each instance. This approach enables CloudNativePG to securely establish connections with an external server without exposing any passwords in the connection string. Instead, the connection safely references the aforementioned file through the passfile connection parameter. Bootstrap an empty cluster ( initdb ) The initdb bootstrap method is used to create a new PostgreSQL cluster from scratch. It is the default one unless specified differently. The following example contains the full structure of the initdb configuration: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example-initdb spec: instances: 3 bootstrap: initdb: database: app owner: app secret: name: app-secret storage: size: 1Gi The above example of bootstrap will: create a new PGDATA folder using PostgreSQL's native initdb command create an unprivileged user named app set the password of the latter ( app ) using the one in the app-secret secret (make sure that username matches the same name of the owner ) create a database called app owned by the app user. Thanks to the convention over configuration paradigm , you can let the operator choose a default database name ( app ) and a default application user name (same as the database name), as well as randomly generate a secure password for both the superuser and the application user in PostgreSQL. Alternatively, you can generate your password, store it as a secret, and use it in the PostgreSQL cluster - as described in the above example. The supplied secret must comply with the specifications of the kubernetes.io/basic-auth type . As a result, the username in the secret must match the one of the owner (for the application secret) and postgres for the superuser one. The following is an example of a basic-auth secret: apiVersion: v1 data: username: YXBw password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= kind: Secret metadata: name: app-secret type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth The application database is the one that should be used to store application data. Applications should connect to the cluster with the user that owns the application database. Important If you need to create additional users, please refer to \"Declarative database role management\" . In case you don't supply any database name, the operator will proceed by convention and create the app database, and adds it to the cluster definition using a defaulting webhook . The user that owns the database defaults to the database name instead. The application user is not used internally by the operator, which instead relies on the superuser to reconcile the cluster with the desired status. Passing Options to initdb The PostgreSQL data directory is initialized using the initdb PostgreSQL command . CloudNativePG enables you to customize the behavior of initdb to modify settings such as default locale configurations and data checksums. Warning CloudNativePG acts only as a direct proxy to initdb for locale-related options, due to the ongoing and significant enhancements in PostgreSQL's locale support. It is your responsibility to ensure that the correct options are provided, following the PostgreSQL documentation, and to verify that the bootstrap process completes successfully. To include custom options in the initdb command, you can use the following parameters: builtinLocale When builtinLocale is set to a value, CloudNativePG passes it to the --builtin-locale option in initdb . This option controls the builtin locale, as defined in \"Locale Support\" from the PostgreSQL documentation (default: empty). Note that this option requires localeProvider to be set to builtin . Available from PostgreSQL 17. dataChecksums When dataChecksums is set to true , CloudNativePG invokes the -k option in initdb to enable checksums on data pages and help detect corruption by the I/O system - that would otherwise be silent (default: false ). encoding When encoding set to a value, CloudNativePG passes it to the --encoding option in initdb , which selects the encoding of the template database (default: UTF8 ). icuLocale When icuLocale is set to a value, CloudNativePG passes it to the --icu-locale option in initdb . This option controls the ICU locale, as defined in \"Locale Support\" from the PostgreSQL documentation (default: empty). Note that this option requires localeProvider to be set to icu . Available from PostgreSQL 15. icuRules When icuRules is set to a value, CloudNativePG passes it to the --icu-rules option in initdb . This option controls the ICU locale, as defined in \"Locale Support\" from the PostgreSQL documentation (default: empty). Note that this option requires localeProvider to be set to icu . Available from PostgreSQL 16. locale When locale is set to a value, CloudNativePG passes it to the --locale option in initdb . This option controls the locale, as defined in \"Locale Support\" from the PostgreSQL documentation. By default, the locale parameter is empty. In this case, environment variables such as LANG are used to determine the locale. Be aware that these variables can vary between container images, potentially leading to inconsistent behavior. localeCollate When localeCollate is set to a value, CloudNativePG passes it to the --lc-collate option in initdb . This option controls the collation order ( LC_COLLATE subcategory), as defined in \"Locale Support\" from the PostgreSQL documentation (default: C ). localeCType When localeCType is set to a value, CloudNativePG passes it to the --lc-ctype option in initdb . This option controls the collation order ( LC_CTYPE subcategory), as defined in \"Locale Support\" from the PostgreSQL documentation (default: C ). localeProvider When localeProvider is set to a value, CloudNativePG passes it to the --locale-provider option in initdb . This option controls the locale provider, as defined in \"Locale Support\" from the PostgreSQL documentation (default: empty, which means libc for PostgreSQL). Available from PostgreSQL 15. walSegmentSize When walSegmentSize is set to a value, CloudNativePG passes it to the --wal-segsize option in initdb (default: not set - defined by PostgreSQL as 16 megabytes). Note The only two locale options that CloudNativePG implements during the initdb bootstrap refer to the LC_COLLATE and LC_TYPE subcategories. The remaining locale subcategories can be configured directly in the PostgreSQL configuration, using the lc_messages , lc_monetary , lc_numeric , and lc_time parameters. The following example enables data checksums and sets the default encoding to LATIN1 : apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example-initdb spec: instances: 3 bootstrap: initdb: database: app owner: app dataChecksums: true encoding: 'LATIN1' storage: size: 1Gi Warning CloudNativePG supports another way to customize the behavior of the initdb invocation, using the options subsection. However, given that there are options that can break the behavior of the operator (such as --auth or -d ), this technique is deprecated and will be removed from future versions of the API. Executing Queries After Initialization You can specify a custom list of queries that will be executed once, immediately after the cluster is created and configured. These queries will be executed as the superuser ( postgres ) against three different databases, in this specific order: The postgres database ( postInit section) The template1 database ( postInitTemplate section) The application database ( postInitApplication section) For each of these sections, CloudNativePG provides two ways to specify custom queries, executed in the following order: As a list of SQL queries in the cluster's definition ( postInitSQL , postInitTemplateSQL , and postInitApplicationSQL stanzas) As a list of Secrets and/or ConfigMaps, each containing a SQL script to be executed ( postInitSQLRefs , postInitTemplateSQLRefs , and postInitApplicationSQLRefs stanzas). Secrets are processed before ConfigMaps. Objects in each list will be processed sequentially. Warning Use the postInit , postInitTemplate , and postInitApplication options with extreme care, as queries are run as a superuser and can disrupt the entire cluster. An error in any of those queries will interrupt the bootstrap phase, leaving the cluster incomplete and requiring manual intervention. Important Ensure the existence of entries inside the ConfigMaps or Secrets specified in postInitSQLRefs , postInitTemplateSQLRefs , and postInitApplicationSQLRefs , otherwise the bootstrap will fail. Errors in any of those SQL files will prevent the bootstrap phase from completing successfully. The following example runs a single SQL query as part of the postInitSQL stanza: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example-initdb spec: instances: 3 bootstrap: initdb: database: app owner: app dataChecksums: true localeCollate: 'en_US' localeCType: 'en_US' postInitSQL: - CREATE DATABASE angus storage: size: 1Gi The example below relies on postInitApplicationSQLRefs to specify a secret and a ConfigMap containing the queries to run after the initialization on the application database: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example-initdb spec: instances: 3 bootstrap: initdb: database: app owner: app postInitApplicationSQLRefs: secretRefs: - name: my-secret key: secret.sql configMapRefs: - name: my-configmap key: configmap.sql storage: size: 1Gi Note Within SQL scripts, each SQL statement is executed in a single exec on the server according to the PostgreSQL semantics . Comments can be included, but internal commands like psql cannot. Bootstrap from another cluster CloudNativePG enables bootstrapping a cluster starting from another one of the same major version. This operation can be carried out either connecting directly to the source cluster via streaming replication ( pg_basebackup ), or indirectly via an existing physical base backup ( recovery ). The source cluster must be defined in the externalClusters section, identified by name (our recommendation is to use the same name of the origin cluster). Important By default the recovery method strictly uses the name of the cluster in the externalClusters section to locate the main folder of the backup data within the object store, which is normally reserved for the name of the server. You can specify a different one with the barmanObjectStore.serverName property (by default assigned to the value of name in the external cluster definition). Bootstrap from a backup ( recovery ) Given the variety of backup methods and combinations of backup storage options provided by the CloudNativePG operator for recovery , please refer to the dedicated \"Recovery\" section for detailed guidance on each method. Bootstrap from a live cluster ( pg_basebackup ) The pg_basebackup bootstrap mode allows you to create a new cluster ( target ) as an exact physical copy of an existing and binary-compatible PostgreSQL instance ( source ) managed by CloudNativePG, using a valid streaming replication connection. The source instance can either be a primary or a standby PostgreSQL server. It\u2019s crucial to thoroughly review the requirements section below, as the pros and cons of PostgreSQL physical replication fully apply. The primary use cases for this method include: Reporting and business intelligence clusters that need to be regenerated periodically (daily, weekly) Test databases containing live data that require periodic regeneration (daily, weekly, monthly) and anonymization Rapid spin-up of a standalone replica cluster Physical migrations of CloudNativePG clusters to different namespaces or Kubernetes clusters Important Avoid using this method, based on physical replication, to migrate an existing PostgreSQL cluster outside of Kubernetes into CloudNativePG, unless you are completely certain that all requirements are met and the operation has been thoroughly tested. The CloudNativePG community does not endorse this approach for such use cases, and recommends using logical import instead. It is exceedingly rare that all requirements for physical replication are met in a way that seamlessly works with CloudNativePG. Warning In its current implementation, this method clones the source PostgreSQL instance, thereby creating a snapshot . Once the cloning process has finished, the new cluster is immediately started. Refer to \"Current limitations\" for more details. Similar to the recovery bootstrap method, once the cloning operation is complete, the operator takes full ownership of the target cluster, starting from the first instance. This includes overriding certain configuration parameters as required by CloudNativePG, resetting the superuser password, creating the streaming_replica user, managing replicas, and more. The resulting cluster operates independently from the source instance. Important Configuring the network connection between the target and source instances lies outside the scope of CloudNativePG documentation, as it depends heavily on the specific context and environment. The streaming replication client on the target instance, managed transparently by pg_basebackup , can authenticate on the source instance using one of the following methods: Username/password TLS client certificate Both authentication methods are detailed below. Requirements The following requirements apply to the pg_basebackup bootstrap method: target and source must have the same hardware architecture target and source must have the same major PostgreSQL version target and source must have the same tablespaces source must be configured with enough max_wal_senders to grant access from the target for this one-off operation by providing at least one walsender for the backup plus one for WAL streaming the network between source and target must be configured to enable the target instance to connect to the PostgreSQL port on the source instance source must have a role with REPLICATION LOGIN privileges and must accept connections from the target instance for this role in pg_hba.conf , preferably via TLS (see \"About the replication user\" below) target must be able to successfully connect to the source PostgreSQL instance using a role with REPLICATION LOGIN privileges Seealso For further information, please refer to the \"Planning\" section for Warm Standby , the pg_basebackup page and the \"High Availability, Load Balancing, and Replication\" chapter in the PostgreSQL documentation. About the replication user As explained in the requirements section, you need to have a user with either the SUPERUSER or, preferably, just the REPLICATION privilege in the source instance. If the source database is created with CloudNativePG, you can reuse the streaming_replica user and take advantage of client TLS certificates authentication (which, by default, is the only allowed connection method for streaming_replica ). For all other cases, including outside Kubernetes, please verify that you already have a user with the REPLICATION privilege, or create a new one by following the instructions below. As postgres user on the source system, please run: createuser -P --replication streaming_replica Enter the password at the prompt and save it for later, as you will need to add it to a secret in the target instance. Note Although the name is not important, we will use streaming_replica for the sake of simplicity. Feel free to change it as you like, provided you adapt the instructions in the following sections. Username/Password authentication The first authentication method supported by CloudNativePG with the pg_basebackup bootstrap is based on username and password matching. Make sure you have the following information before you start the procedure: location of the source instance, identified by a hostname or an IP address and a TCP port replication username ( streaming_replica for simplicity) password You might need to add a line similar to the following to the pg_hba.conf file on the source PostgreSQL instance: # A more restrictive rule for TLS and IP of origin is recommended host replication streaming_replica all md5 The following manifest creates a new PostgreSQL 17.4 cluster, called target-db , using the pg_basebackup bootstrap method to clone an external PostgreSQL cluster defined as source-db (in the externalClusters array). As you can see, the source-db definition points to the source-db.foo.com host and connects as the streaming_replica user, whose password is stored in the password key of the source-db-replica-user secret. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: target-db spec: instances: 3 imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:17.4 bootstrap: pg_basebackup: source: source-db storage: size: 1Gi externalClusters: - name: source-db connectionParameters: host: source-db.foo.com user: streaming_replica password: name: source-db-replica-user key: password All the requirements must be met for the clone operation to work, including the same PostgreSQL version (in our case 17.4). TLS certificate authentication The second authentication method supported by CloudNativePG with the pg_basebackup bootstrap is based on TLS client certificates. This is the recommended approach from a security standpoint. The following example clones an existing PostgreSQL cluster ( cluster-example ) in the same Kubernetes cluster. Note This example can be easily adapted to cover an instance that resides outside the Kubernetes cluster. The manifest defines a new PostgreSQL 17.4 cluster called cluster-clone-tls , which is bootstrapped using the pg_basebackup method from the cluster-example external cluster. The host is identified by the read/write service in the same cluster, while the streaming_replica user is authenticated thanks to the provided keys, certificate, and certification authority information (respectively in the cluster-example-replication and cluster-example-ca secrets). apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-clone-tls spec: instances: 3 imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:17.4 bootstrap: pg_basebackup: source: cluster-example storage: size: 1Gi externalClusters: - name: cluster-example connectionParameters: host: cluster-example-rw.default.svc user: streaming_replica sslmode: verify-full sslKey: name: cluster-example-replication key: tls.key sslCert: name: cluster-example-replication key: tls.crt sslRootCert: name: cluster-example-ca key: ca.crt Configure the application database We also support to configure the application database for cluster which bootstrap from a live cluster, just like the case of initdb and recovery bootstrap method. If the new cluster is created as a replica cluster (with replica mode enabled), application database configuration will be skipped. Important While the Cluster is in recovery mode, no changes to the database, including the catalog, are permitted. This restriction includes any role overrides, which are deferred until the Cluster transitions to primary. During the recovery phase, roles remain as defined in the source cluster. The example below configures the app database with the owner app and the password stored in the provided secret app-secret , following the bootstrap from a live cluster. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: bootstrap: pg_basebackup: database: app owner: app secret: name: app-secret source: cluster-example With the above configuration, the following will happen only after recovery is completed : If the app database does not exist, it will be created. If the app user does not exist, it will be created. If the app user is not the owner of the app database, ownership will be granted to the app user. If the username value matches the owner value in the secret, the password for the application user (the app user in this case) will be updated to the password value in the secret. Current limitations Snapshot copy The pg_basebackup method takes a snapshot of the source instance in the form of a PostgreSQL base backup. All transactions written from the start of the backup to the correct termination of the backup will be streamed to the target instance using a second connection (see the --wal-method=stream option for pg_basebackup ). Once the backup is completed, the new instance will be started on a new timeline and diverge from the source. For this reason, it is advised to stop all write operations to the source database before migrating to the target database. Note that this limitation applies only if the target cluster is not defined as a replica cluster. Important Before you attempt a migration, you must test both the procedure and the applications. In particular, it is fundamental that you run the migration procedure as many times as needed to systematically measure the downtime of your applications in production.","title":"Bootstrap"},{"location":"bootstrap/#bootstrap","text":"This section describes the options available to create a new PostgreSQL cluster and the design rationale behind them. There are primarily two ways to bootstrap a new cluster: from scratch ( initdb ) from an existing PostgreSQL cluster, either directly ( pg_basebackup ) or indirectly through a physical base backup ( recovery ) The initdb bootstrap also provides the option to import one or more databases from an existing PostgreSQL cluster, even if it's outside Kubernetes or running a different major version of PostgreSQL. For more detailed information about this feature, please refer to the \"Importing Postgres databases\" section. Important Bootstrapping from an existing cluster enables the creation of a replica cluster \u2014an independent PostgreSQL cluster that remains in continuous recovery, stays synchronized with the source cluster, and accepts read-only connections. For more details, refer to the Replica Cluster section . Warning CloudNativePG requires both the postgres user and database to always exist. Using the local Unix Domain Socket, it needs to connect as the postgres user to the postgres database via peer authentication in order to perform administrative tasks on the cluster. DO NOT DELETE the postgres user or the postgres database!!!

This method is particularly useful for migrating databases to CloudNativePG, although meeting all requirements can be challenging. Be sure to review the warnings in the pg_basebackup subsection carefully. In contrast to the initdb method, both recovery and pg_basebackup create a new cluster based on another one (either offline or online) and can be used to spin up replica clusters.

Important By default the recovery method strictly uses the name of the cluster in the externalClusters section to locate the main folder of the backup data within the object store, which is normally reserved for the name of the server. You can specify a different one with the barmanObjectStore.serverName property (by default assigned to the value of name in the external cluster definition).","title":"Bootstrap from another cluster"},{"location":"bootstrap/#bootstrap-from-a-backup-recovery","text":"Given the variety of backup methods and combinations of backup storage options provided by the CloudNativePG operator for recovery , please refer to the dedicated \"Recovery\" section for detailed guidance on each method.","title":"Bootstrap from a backup (recovery)"},{"location":"bootstrap/#bootstrap-from-a-live-cluster-pg_basebackup","text":"The pg_basebackup bootstrap mode allows you to create a new cluster ( target ) as an exact physical copy of an existing and binary-compatible PostgreSQL instance ( source ) managed by CloudNativePG, using a valid streaming replication connection. The source instance can either be a primary or a standby PostgreSQL server. It\u2019s crucial to thoroughly review the requirements section below, as the pros and cons of PostgreSQL physical replication fully apply. The primary use cases for this method include: Reporting and business intelligence clusters that need to be regenerated periodically (daily, weekly) Test databases containing live data that require periodic regeneration (daily, weekly, monthly) and anonymization Rapid spin-up of a standalone replica cluster Physical migrations of CloudNativePG clusters to different namespaces or Kubernetes clusters Important Avoid using this method, based on physical replication, to migrate an existing PostgreSQL cluster outside of Kubernetes into CloudNativePG, unless you are completely certain that all requirements are met and the operation has been thoroughly tested. The CloudNativePG community does not endorse this approach for such use cases, and recommends using logical import instead. It is exceedingly rare that all requirements for physical replication are met in a way that seamlessly works with CloudNativePG. Warning In its current implementation, this method clones the source PostgreSQL instance, thereby creating a snapshot . Once the cloning process has finished, the new cluster is immediately started. Refer to \"Current limitations\" for more details. Similar to the recovery bootstrap method, once the cloning operation is complete, the operator takes full ownership of the target cluster, starting from the first instance. This includes overriding certain configuration parameters as required by CloudNativePG, resetting the superuser password, creating the streaming_replica user, managing replicas, and more. The resulting cluster operates independently from the source instance. Important Configuring the network connection between the target and source instances lies outside the scope of CloudNativePG documentation, as it depends heavily on the specific context and environment.

To set up a cluster, the operator requires: A server certification authority (CA) certificate A server TLS certificate signed by the server CA A client CA certificate A streaming replication client certificate generated by the client CA Note You can find all the secrets used by the cluster and their expiration dates in the cluster's status. CloudNativePG is very flexible when it comes to TLS certificates. It primarily operates in two modes: Operator managed \u2013 Certificates are internally managed by the operator in a fully automated way and signed using a CA created by CloudNativePG. User provided \u2013 Certificates are generated outside the operator and imported in the cluster definition as secrets. CloudNativePG integrates itself with cert-manager (See Cert-manager example .) You can also choose a hybrid approach, where only part of the certificates is generated outside CNPG. Note The operator and instances verify server certificates against the CA only, disregarding the DNS name. This approach is due to the typical absence of DNS names in user-provided certificates for the <cluster>-rw service used for communication within the cluster. Operator-Managed Mode By default, the operator automatically generates a single Certificate Authority (CA) to issue both client and server certificates. These certificates are managed continuously by the operator, with automatic renewal 7 days before expiration (within a 90-day validity period). Info You can adjust this default behavior by configuring the CERTIFICATE_DURATION and EXPIRING_CHECK_THRESHOLD environment variables. For detailed guidance, refer to the Operator Configuration . Important Certificate renewal does not cause any downtime for the PostgreSQL server, as a simple reload operation is sufficient. However, any user-managed certificates not controlled by CloudNativePG must be re-issued following the renewal process. When generating certificates, the operator assumes that the Kubernetes cluster's DNS zone is set to cluster.local by default. This behavior can be customized by setting the KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN environment variable. A convenient alternative is to use the operator's configuration capability . Server certificates Server CA secret The operator generates a self-signed CA and stores it in a generic secret containing the following keys: ca.crt \u2013 CA certificate used to validate the server certificate, used as sslrootcert in clients' connection strings. ca.key \u2013 The key used to sign the server SSL certificate automatically. Server TLS secret The operator uses the generated self-signed CA to sign a server TLS certificate. It's stored in a secret of type kubernetes.io/tls and configured to be used as ssl_cert_file and ssl_key_file by the instances. This approach enables clients to verify their identity and connect securely. Server alternative DNS names In addition to the default ones, you can specify DNS server alternative names as part of the generated server TLS secret. Client certificates Client CA secret By default, the same self-signed CA as the server CA is used. The public part is passed as ssl_ca_file to all the instances so it can verify client certificates it signed. The private key is stored in the same secret and used to sign client certificates generated by the kubectl cnpg plugin. Client streaming_replica certificate The operator uses the generated self-signed CA to sign a client certificate for the user streaming_replica , storing it in a secret of type kubernetes.io/tls . To allow secure connection to the primary instance, this certificate is passed as sslcert and sslkey in the replicas' connection strings. User-provided certificates mode Server certificates If required, you can also provide the two server certificates, generating them using a separate component such as cert-manager . To use a custom server TLS certificate for a cluster, you must specify the following parameters: serverTLSSecret \u2013 The name of a secret of type kubernetes.io/tls containing the server TLS certificate. It must contain both the standard tls.crt and tls.key keys. serverCASecret \u2013 The name of a secret containing the ca.crt key. Note The operator still creates and manages the two secrets related to client certificates. Note The operator and instances verify server certificates against the CA only, disregarding the DNS name. This approach is due to the typical absence of DNS names in user-provided certificates for the <cluster>-rw service used for communication within the cluster. Note If you want ConfigMaps and secrets to be reloaded by instances, you can add a label with the key cnpg.io/reload to it. Otherwise you must reload the instances using the kubectl cnpg reload subcommand. Example Given the following files: server-ca.crt \u2013 The certificate of the CA that signed the server TLS certificate. server.crt \u2013 The certificate of the server TLS certificate. server.key \u2013 The private key of the server TLS certificate. Create a secret containing the CA certificate: kubectl create secret generic my-postgresql-server-ca \\ --from-file=ca.crt=./server-ca.crt Create a secret with the TLS certificate: kubectl create secret tls my-postgresql-server \\ --cert=./server.crt --key=./server.key Create a PostgreSQL cluster referencing those secrets: kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 certificates: serverCASecret: my-postgresql-server-ca serverTLSSecret: my-postgresql-server storage: storageClass: standard size: 1Gi EOF The new cluster uses the provided server certificates for TLS connections.

Metadata Appears in: PodTemplateSpec ServiceAccountTemplate ServiceTemplateSpec Metadata is a structure similar to the metav1.ObjectMeta, but still parseable by controller-gen to create a suitable CRD for the user. The comment of PodTemplateSpec has an explanation of why we are not using the core data types. Field Description name string The name of the resource. Only supported for certain types labels map[string]string Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.

OnlineConfiguration Appears in: BackupSpec ScheduledBackupSpec VolumeSnapshotConfiguration OnlineConfiguration contains the configuration parameters for the online volume snapshot Field Description waitForArchive bool If false, the function will return immediately after the backup is completed, without waiting for WAL to be archived. This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving. Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless. By default, or when this parameter is true, pg_backup_stop will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is enabled. On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always. If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger an immediate segment switch. immediateCheckpoint bool Control whether the I/O workload for the backup initial checkpoint will be limited, according to the checkpoint_completion_target setting on the PostgreSQL server. If set to true, an immediate checkpoint will be used, meaning PostgreSQL will complete the checkpoint as soon as possible. false by default.

Default is false . login bool Whether the role is allowed to log in. A role having the login attribute can be thought of as a user. Roles without this attribute are useful for managing database privileges, but are not users in the usual sense of the word. Default is false . replication bool Whether a role is a replication role. A role must have this attribute (or be a superuser) in order to be able to connect to the server in replication mode (physical or logical replication) and in order to be able to create or drop replication slots. A role having the replication attribute is a very highly privileged role, and should only be used on roles actually used for replication. Default is false . bypassrls bool Whether a role bypasses every row-level security (RLS) policy. Default is false .

Field Description nodeLabelsAntiAffinity []string A list of node labels values to extract and compare to evaluate if the pods reside in the same topology or not enabled [Required] bool This flag enables the constraints for sync replicas SynchronizeReplicasConfiguration Appears in: ReplicationSlotsConfiguration SynchronizeReplicasConfiguration contains the configuration for the synchronization of user defined physical replication slots Field Description enabled [Required] bool When set to true, every replication slot that is on the primary is synchronized on each standby excludePatterns []string List of regular expression patterns to match the names of replication slots to be excluded (by default empty) SynchronousReplicaConfiguration Appears in: PostgresConfiguration SynchronousReplicaConfiguration contains the configuration of the PostgreSQL synchronous replication feature. Important: at this moment, also .spec.minSyncReplicas and .spec.maxSyncReplicas need to be considered. Field Description method [Required] SynchronousReplicaConfigurationMethod Method to select synchronous replication standbys from the listed servers, accepting 'any' (quorum-based synchronous replication) or 'first' (priority-based synchronous replication) as values. number [Required] int Specifies the number of synchronous standby servers that transactions must wait for responses from. maxStandbyNamesFromCluster int Specifies the maximum number of local cluster pods that can be automatically included in the synchronous_standby_names option in PostgreSQL. standbyNamesPre []string A user-defined list of application names to be added to synchronous_standby_names before local cluster pods (the order is only useful for priority-based synchronous replication). standbyNamesPost []string A user-defined list of application names to be added to synchronous_standby_names after local cluster pods (the order is only useful for priority-based synchronous replication). dataDurability DataDurabilityLevel If set to \"required\", data durability is strictly enforced. Write operations with synchronous commit settings ( on , remote_write , or remote_apply ) will block if there are insufficient healthy replicas, ensuring data persistence. If set to \"preferred\", data durability is maintained when healthy replicas are available, but the required number of instances will adjust dynamically if replicas become unavailable. This setting relaxes strict durability enforcement to allow for operational continuity. This setting is only applicable if both standbyNamesPre and standbyNamesPost are unset (empty).

This ability is useful for several Postgres features and extensions that require additional data files. In CloudNativePG, the .spec.projectedVolumeTemplate field is a projected volume template in Kubernetes that allows you to mount arbitrary data under the /projected folder in Postgres pods. This simple example shows how to mount an existing TLS secret (named sample-secret ) as files into Postgres pods. The values for the secret keys tls.crt and tls.key in sample-secret are mounted as files into the paths /projected/certificate/tls.crt and /projected/certificate/tls.key in the Postgres pod. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example-projected-volumes spec: instances: 3 projectedVolumeTemplate: sources: - secret: name: sample-secret items: - key: tls.crt path: certificate/tls.crt - key: tls.key path: certificate/tls.key storage: size: 1Gi You can find a complete example that uses a projected volume template to mount the secret and ConfigMap in the cluster-example-projected-volume.yaml deployment manifest. Ephemeral volumes CloudNativePG relies on ephemeral volumes for part of the internal activities. Ephemeral volumes exist for the sole duration of a pod's life, without persisting across pod restarts. Volume Claim Template for Temporary Storage The operator uses by default an emptyDir volume, which can be customized by using the .spec.ephemeralVolumesSizeLimit field . This can be overridden by specifying a volume claim template in the .spec.ephemeralVolumeSource field. In the following example, a 1Gi ephemeral volume is set. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example-ephemeral-volume-source spec: instances: 3 ephemeralVolumeSource: volumeClaimTemplate: spec: accessModes: [\"ReadWriteOnce\"] # example storageClassName, replace with one existing in your Kubernetes cluster storageClassName: \"scratch-storage-class\" resources: requests: storage: 1Gi Both .spec.emphemeralVolumeSource and .spec.ephemeralVolumesSizeLimit.temporaryData cannot be specified simultaneously. Volume for shared memory This volume is used as shared memory space for Postgres and as an ephemeral type but stored in memory. You can configure an upper bound on the size using the .spec.ephemeralVolumesSizeLimit.shm field in the cluster spec. Use this field only in case of PostgreSQL running with posix shared memory dynamic allocation . Environment variables You can customize some system behavior using environment variables. One example is the LDAPCONF variable, which can point to a custom LDAP configuration file. Another example is the TZ environment variable, which represents the timezone used by the PostgreSQL container. CloudNativePG allows you to set custom environment variables using the env and the envFrom stanza of the cluster specification. This example defines a PostgreSQL cluster using the Australia/Sydney timezone as the default cluster-level timezone: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 env: - name: TZ value: Australia/Sydney storage: size: 1Gi The envFrom stanza can refer to ConfigMaps or secrets to use their content as environment variables: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 envFrom: - configMapRef: name: config-map-name - secretRef: name: secret-name storage: size: 1Gi The operator doesn't allow setting the following environment variables: POD_NAME NAMESPACE Any environment variable whose name starts with PG . Any change in the env or in the envFrom section triggers a rolling update of the PostgreSQL pods.

In brief, a pooler in CloudNativePG is a deployment of PgBouncer pods that sits between your applications and a PostgreSQL service, for example, the rw service. It creates a separate, scalable, configurable, and highly available database access layer. Architecture The following diagram highlights how introducing a database access layer based on PgBouncer changes the architecture of CloudNativePG. Instead of directly connecting to the PostgreSQL primary service, applications can connect to the equivalent service for PgBouncer. This ability enables reuse of existing connections for faster performance and better resource management on the PostgreSQL side. Quick start This example helps to show how CloudNativePG implements a PgBouncer pooler: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Pooler metadata: name: pooler-example-rw spec: cluster: name: cluster-example instances: 3 type: rw pgbouncer: poolMode: session parameters: max_client_conn: \"1000\" default_pool_size: \"10\" Important The pooler name can't be the same as any cluster name in the same namespace. This example creates a Pooler resource called pooler-example-rw that's strictly associated with the Postgres Cluster resource called cluster-example . It points to the primary, identified by the read/write service ( rw , therefore cluster-example-rw ). The Pooler resource must live in the same namespace as the Postgres cluster. It consists of a Kubernetes deployment of 3 pods running the latest stable image of PgBouncer , configured with the session pooling mode and accepting up to 1000 connections each. The default pool size is 10 user/database pairs toward PostgreSQL. Important The Pooler resource sets only the * fallback database in PgBouncer. This setting means that that all parameters in the connection strings passed from the client are relayed to the PostgreSQL server. For details, see \"Section [databases]\" in the PgBouncer documentation . CloudNativePG also creates a secret with the same name as the pooler containing the configuration files used with PgBouncer. API reference For details, see PgBouncerSpec in the API reference. Pooler resource lifecycle Pooler resources aren't cluster-managed resources. You create poolers manually when they're needed. You can also deploy multiple poolers per PostgreSQL cluster. What's important is that the life cycles of the Cluster and the Pooler resources are currently independent. Deleting the cluster doesn't imply the deletion of the pooler, and vice versa. Important Once you know how a pooler works, you have full freedom in terms of possible architectures. You can have clusters without poolers, clusters with a single pooler, or clusters with several poolers, that is, one per application. Important When the operator is upgraded, the pooler pods will undergo a rolling upgrade. This is necessary to ensure that the instance manager within the pooler pods is also upgraded. Security Any PgBouncer pooler is transparently integrated with CloudNativePG support for in-transit encryption by way of TLS connections, both on the client (application) and server (PostgreSQL) side of the pool. Specifically, PgBouncer reuses the certificates of the PostgreSQL server. It also uses TLS client certificate authentication to connect to the PostgreSQL server to run the auth_query for clients' password authentication (see Authentication ). Containers run as the pgbouncer system user, and access to the pgbouncer database is allowed only by way of local connections, through peer authentication. Certificates By default, a PgBouncer pooler uses the same certificates that are used by the cluster. However, if you provide those certificates, the pooler accepts secrets with the following formats: Basic Auth TLS Opaque In the Opaque case, it looks for the following specific keys that need to be used: tls.crt tls.key So you can treat this secret as a TLS secret, and start from there. Authentication Password-based authentication is the only supported method for clients of PgBouncer in CloudNativePG. Internally, the implementation relies on PgBouncer's auth_user and auth_query options. Specifically, the operator: Creates a standard user called cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer in the PostgreSQL server Creates the lookup function in the postgres database and grants execution privileges to the cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer user (PoLA) Issues a TLS certificate for this user Sets cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer as the auth_user Configures PgBouncer to use the TLS certificate to authenticate cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer against the PostgreSQL server Removes all the above when it detects that a cluster doesn't have any pooler associated to it Important If you specify your own secrets, the operator doesn't automatically integrate the pooler. To manually integrate the pooler, if you specified your own secrets, you must run the following queries from inside your cluster. First, you must create the role: CREATE ROLE cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer WITH LOGIN; Then, for each application database, grant the permission for cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer to connect to it: GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE { database name here } TO cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer; Finally, as a superuser connect in each application database, and then create the authentication function inside each of the application databases: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.user_search(uname TEXT) RETURNS TABLE (usename name, passwd text) LANGUAGE sql SECURITY DEFINER AS 'SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_catalog.pg_shadow WHERE usename=$1;'; REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION public.user_search(text) FROM public; GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.user_search(text) TO cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer; Important Given that user_search is a SECURITY DEFINER function, you need to create it through a role with SUPERUSER privileges, such as the postgres user. Pod templates You can take advantage of pod templates specification in the template section of a Pooler resource. For details, see PoolerSpec in the API reference. Using templates, you can configure pods as you like, including fine control over affinity and anti-affinity rules for pods and nodes. By default, containers use images from ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/pgbouncer . This example shows Pooler specifying `PodAntiAffinity``: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Pooler metadata: name: pooler-example-rw spec: cluster: name: cluster-example instances: 3 type: rw template: metadata: labels: app: pooler spec: containers: [] affinity: podAntiAffinity: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: app operator: In values: - pooler topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\" Note Explicitly set .spec.template.spec.containers to [] when not modified, as it's a required field for a PodSpec . If .spec.template.spec.containers isn't set, the Kubernetes api-server returns the following error when trying to apply the manifest: error validating \"pooler.yaml\": error validating data: ValidationError(Pooler.spec.template.spec): missing required field \"containers\" This example sets resources and changes the used image: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Pooler metadata: name: pooler-example-rw spec: cluster: name: cluster-example instances: 3 type: rw template: metadata: labels: app: pooler spec: containers: - name: pgbouncer image: my-pgbouncer:latest resources: requests: cpu: \"0.1\" memory: 100Mi limits: cpu: \"0.5\" memory: 500Mi Service Template Sometimes, your pooler will require some different labels, annotations, or even change the type of the service, you can achieve that by using the serviceTemplate field: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Pooler metadata: name: pooler-example-rw spec: cluster: name: cluster-example instances: 3 type: rw serviceTemplate: metadata: labels: app: pooler spec: type: LoadBalancer pgbouncer: poolMode: session parameters: max_client_conn: \"1000\" default_pool_size: \"10\" The operator by default adds a ServicePort with the following data: ports: - name: pgbouncer port: 5432 protocol: TCP targetPort: pgbouncer Warning Specifying a ServicePort with the name pgbouncer or the port 5432 will prevent the default ServicePort from being added. This because ServicePort entries with the same name or port are not allowed on Kubernetes and result in errors. High availability (HA) Because of Kubernetes' deployments, you can configure your pooler to run on a single instance or over multiple pods. The exposed service makes sure that your clients are randomly distributed over the available pods running PgBouncer, which then manages and reuses connections toward the underlying server (if using the rw service) or servers (if using the ro service with multiple replicas). Warning If your infrastructure spans multiple availability zones with high latency across them, be aware of network hops. Consider, for example, the case of your application running in zone 2, connecting to PgBouncer running in zone 3, and pointing to the PostgreSQL primary in zone 1. PgBouncer configuration options The operator manages most of the configuration options for PgBouncer , allowing you to modify only a subset of them. Warning You are responsible for correctly setting the value of each option, as the operator doesn't validate them. These are the PgBouncer options you can customize, with links to the PgBouncer documentation for each parameter. Unless stated otherwise, the default values are the ones directly set by PgBouncer. application_name_add_host autodb_idle_timeout cancel_wait_timeout client_idle_timeout client_login_timeout default_pool_size disable_pqexec dns_max_ttl dns_nxdomain_ttl idle_transaction_timeout ignore_startup_parameters : to be appended to extra_float_digits,options - required by CloudNativePG listen_backlog log_connections log_disconnections log_pooler_errors log_stats : by default disabled ( 0 ), given that statistics are already collected by the Prometheus export as described in the \"Monitoring\" section below max_client_conn max_db_connections max_packet_size max_prepared_statements max_user_connections min_pool_size pkt_buf query_timeout query_wait_timeout reserve_pool_size reserve_pool_timeout sbuf_loopcnt server_check_delay server_check_query server_connect_timeout server_fast_close server_idle_timeout server_lifetime server_login_retry server_reset_query server_reset_query_always server_round_robin server_tls_ciphers server_tls_protocols stats_period suspend_timeout tcp_defer_accept tcp_keepalive tcp_keepcnt tcp_keepidle tcp_keepintvl tcp_user_timeout tcp_socket_buffer track_extra_parameters verbose Customizations of the PgBouncer configuration are written declaratively in the .spec.pgbouncer.parameters map. The operator reacts to the changes in the pooler specification, and every PgBouncer instance reloads the updated configuration without disrupting the service. Warning Every PgBouncer pod has the same configuration, aligned with the parameters in the specification. A mistake in these parameters might disrupt the operability of the whole pooler. The operator doesn't validate the value of any option. Monitoring The PgBouncer implementation of the Pooler comes with a default Prometheus exporter. It makes available several metrics having the cnpg_pgbouncer_ prefix by running: SHOW LISTS (prefix: cnpg_pgbouncer_lists ) SHOW POOLS (prefix: cnpg_pgbouncer_pools ) SHOW STATS (prefix: cnpg_pgbouncer_stats ) Like the CloudNativePG instance, the exporter runs on port 9127 of each pod running PgBouncer and also provides metrics related to the Go runtime (with the prefix go_* ). Info You can inspect the exported metrics on a pod running PgBouncer. For instructions, see How to inspect the exported metrics . Make sure that you use the correct IP and the 9127 port.

As for clusters, a specific pooler can be monitored using the Prometheus operator's resource PodMonitor . A PodMonitor correctly pointing to a pooler can be created by the operator by setting .spec.monitoring.enablePodMonitor to true in the Pooler resource. The default is false . Important Any change to PodMonitor created automatically is overridden by the operator at the next reconciliation cycle. If you need to customize it, you can do so as shown in the following example. To deploy a PodMonitor for a specific pooler manually, you can define it as follows and change it as needed: apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: PodMonitor metadata: name: <POOLER_NAME> spec: selector: matchLabels: cnpg.io/poolerName: <POOLER_NAME> podMetricsEndpoints: - port: metrics Logging Logs are directly sent to standard output, in JSON format, like in the following example: { \"level\": \"info\", \"ts\": SECONDS.MICROSECONDS, \"msg\": \"record\", \"pipe\": \"stderr\", \"record\": { \"timestamp\": \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.MS UTC\", \"pid\": \"<PID>\", \"level\": \"LOG\", \"msg\": \"kernel file descriptor limit: 1048576 (hard: 1048576); max_client_conn: 100, max expected fd use: 112\" } } Pausing connections The Pooler specification allows you to take advantage of PgBouncer's PAUSE and RESUME commands, using only declarative configuration. You can ado this using the paused option, which by default is set to false . When set to true , the operator internally invokes the PAUSE command in PgBouncer, which: Closes all active connections toward the PostgreSQL server, after waiting for the queries to complete Pauses any new connection coming from the client When the paused option is reset to false , the operator invokes the RESUME command in PgBouncer, reopening the taps toward the PostgreSQL service defined in the Pooler resource. PAUSE For more information, see PAUSE in the PgBouncer documentation . Important In future versions, the switchover operation will be fully integrated with the PgBouncer pooler and take advantage of the PAUSE / RESUME features to reduce the perceived downtime by client applications. Currently, you can achieve the same results by setting the paused attribute to true , issuing the switchover command through the cnpg plugin , and then restoring the paused attribute to false . Limitations Single PostgreSQL cluster The current implementation of the pooler is designed to work as part of a specific CloudNativePG cluster (a service). It isn't currently possible to create a pooler that spans multiple clusters. Controlled configurability CloudNativePG transparently manages several configuration options that are used for the PgBouncer layer to communicate with PostgreSQL. Such options aren't configurable from outside and include TLS certificates, authentication settings, the databases section, and the users section. Also, considering the specific use case for the single PostgreSQL cluster, the adopted criteria is to explicitly list the options that can be configured by users. Note The adopted solution likely addresses the majority of use cases. It leaves room for the future implementation of a separate operator for PgBouncer to complete the gamma with more advanced and customized scenarios.","title":"Connection pooling"},{"location":"connection_pooling/#connection-pooling","text":"CloudNativePG provides native support for connection pooling with PgBouncer , one of the most popular open source connection poolers for PostgreSQL, through the Pooler custom resource definition (CRD).

It creates a separate, scalable, configurable, and highly available database access layer.","title":"Connection pooling"},{"location":"connection_pooling/#architecture","text":"The following diagram highlights how introducing a database access layer based on PgBouncer changes the architecture of CloudNativePG.

This example creates a Pooler resource called pooler-example-rw that's strictly associated with the Postgres Cluster resource called cluster-example . It points to the primary, identified by the read/write service ( rw , therefore cluster-example-rw ). The Pooler resource must live in the same namespace as the Postgres cluster. It consists of a Kubernetes deployment of 3 pods running the latest stable image of PgBouncer , configured with the session pooling mode and accepting up to 1000 connections each. The default pool size is 10 user/database pairs toward PostgreSQL. Important The Pooler resource sets only the * fallback database in PgBouncer. This setting means that that all parameters in the connection strings passed from the client are relayed to the PostgreSQL server. For details, see \"Section [databases]\" in the PgBouncer documentation . CloudNativePG also creates a secret with the same name as the pooler containing the configuration files used with PgBouncer.

What's important is that the life cycles of the Cluster and the Pooler resources are currently independent. Deleting the cluster doesn't imply the deletion of the pooler, and vice versa. Important Once you know how a pooler works, you have full freedom in terms of possible architectures. You can have clusters without poolers, clusters with a single pooler, or clusters with several poolers, that is, one per application. Important When the operator is upgraded, the pooler pods will undergo a rolling upgrade. This is necessary to ensure that the instance manager within the pooler pods is also upgraded.","title":"Pooler resource lifecycle"},{"location":"connection_pooling/#security","text":"Any PgBouncer pooler is transparently integrated with CloudNativePG support for in-transit encryption by way of TLS connections, both on the client (application) and server (PostgreSQL) side of the pool.

However, if you provide those certificates, the pooler accepts secrets with the following formats: Basic Auth TLS Opaque In the Opaque case, it looks for the following specific keys that need to be used: tls.crt tls.key So you can treat this secret as a TLS secret, and start from there.","title":"Certificates"},{"location":"connection_pooling/#authentication","text":"Password-based authentication is the only supported method for clients of PgBouncer in CloudNativePG. Internally, the implementation relies on PgBouncer's auth_user and auth_query options.

To manually integrate the pooler, if you specified your own secrets, you must run the following queries from inside your cluster. First, you must create the role: CREATE ROLE cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer WITH LOGIN; Then, for each application database, grant the permission for cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer to connect to it: GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE { database name here } TO cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer; Finally, as a superuser connect in each application database, and then create the authentication function inside each of the application databases: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.user_search(uname TEXT) RETURNS TABLE (usename name, passwd text) LANGUAGE sql SECURITY DEFINER AS 'SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_catalog.pg_shadow WHERE usename=$1;'; REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION public.user_search(text) FROM public; GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.user_search(text) TO cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer; Important Given that user_search is a SECURITY DEFINER function, you need to create it through a role with SUPERUSER privileges, such as the postgres user.","title":"Authentication"},{"location":"connection_pooling/#pod-templates","text":"You can take advantage of pod templates specification in the template section of a Pooler resource.

Stateful applications are usually managed with the StatefulSet controller, which creates and reconciles a set of Pods built from the same specification, and assigns them a sticky identity. CloudNativePG implements its own custom controller to manage PostgreSQL instances, instead of relying on the StatefulSet controller. While bringing more complexity to the implementation, this design choice provides the operator with more flexibility on how we manage the cluster, while being transparent on the topology of PostgreSQL clusters. Like many choices in the design realm, different ones lead to other compromises. The following sections discuss a few points where we believe this design choice has made the implementation of CloudNativePG more reliable, and easier to understand. PVC resizing This is a well known limitation of StatefulSet : it does not support resizing PVCs. This is inconvenient for a database. Resizing volumes requires convoluted workarounds. In contrast, CloudNativePG leverages the configured storage class to manage the underlying PVCs directly, and can handle PVC resizing if the storage class supports it. Primary Instances versus Replicas The StatefulSet controller is designed to create a set of Pods from just one template. Given that we use one Pod per PostgreSQL instance, we have two kinds of Pods: primary instance (only one) replicas (multiple, optional) This difference is relevant when deciding the correct deployment strategy to execute for a given operation. Some operations should be performed on the replicas first, and then on the primary, but only after an updated replica is promoted as the new primary. For example, when you want to apply a different PostgreSQL image version, or when you increase configuration parameters like max_connections (which are treated specially by PostgreSQL because CloudNativePG uses hot standby replicas ). While doing that, CloudNativePG considers the PostgreSQL instance's role - and not just its serial number. Sometimes the operator needs to follow the opposite process: work on the primary first and then on the replicas. For example, when you lower max_connections . In that case, CloudNativePG will: apply the new setting to the primary instance restart it apply the new setting on the replicas The StatefulSet controller, being application-independent, can't incorporate this behavior, which is specific to PostgreSQL's native replication technology. Coherence of PVCs PostgreSQL instances can be configured to work with multiple PVCs: this is how WAL storage can be separated from PGDATA . The two data stores need to be coherent from the PostgreSQL point of view, as they're used simultaneously. If you delete the PVC corresponding to the WAL storage of an instance, the PVC where PGDATA is stored will not be usable anymore. This behavior is specific to PostgreSQL and is not implemented in the StatefulSet controller - the latter not being application specific. After the user dropped a PVC, a StatefulSet would just recreate it, leading to a corrupted PostgreSQL instance. CloudNativePG would instead classify the remaining PVC as unusable, and start creating a new pair of PVCs for another instance to join the cluster correctly. Local storage, remote storage, and database size Sometimes you need to take down a Kubernetes node to do an upgrade. After the upgrade, depending on your upgrade strategy, the updated node could go up again, or a new node could replace it. Supposing the unavailable node was hosting a PostgreSQL instance, depending on your database size and your cloud infrastructure, you may prefer to choose one of the following actions: drop the PVC and the Pod residing on the downed node; create a new PVC cloning the data from another PVC; after that, schedule a Pod for it drop the Pod, schedule the Pod in a different node, and mount the PVC from there leave the Pod and the PVC as they are, and wait for the node to be back up. The first solution is practical when your database size permits, allowing you to immediately bring back the desired number of replicas. The second solution is only feasible when you're not using the storage of the local node, and re-mounting the PVC in another host is possible in a reasonable amount of time (which only you and your organization know). The third solution is appropriate when the database is big and uses local node storage for maximum performance and data durability.

The import operation is based on the concept of online logical backups in PostgreSQL, and relies on pg_dump via a network connection to the origin host, and pg_restore . Thanks to native Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) and snapshots, PostgreSQL enables taking consistent backups over the network, in a concurrent manner, without stopping any write activity. Logical backups are also the most common, flexible and reliable technique to perform major upgrades of PostgreSQL versions. As a result, the instructions in this section are suitable for both: importing one or more databases from an existing PostgreSQL instance, even outside Kubernetes importing the database from any PostgreSQL version to one that is either the same or newer, enabling major upgrades of PostgreSQL (e.g. from version 11.x to version 15.x) Warning When performing major upgrades of PostgreSQL you are responsible for making sure that applications are compatible with the new version and that the upgrade path of the objects contained in the database (including extensions) is feasible. In both cases, the operation is performed on a consistent snapshot of the origin database. Important For this reason we suggest to stop write operations on the source before the final import in the Cluster resource, as changes done to the source database after the start of the backup will not be in the destination cluster - hence why this feature is referred to as \"offline import\" or \"offline major upgrade\". How it works Conceptually, the import requires you to create a new cluster from scratch ( destination cluster ), using the initdb bootstrap method , and then complete the initdb.import subsection to import objects from an existing Postgres cluster ( source cluster ). As per PostgreSQL recommendation, we suggest that the PostgreSQL major version of the destination cluster is greater or equal than the one of the source cluster . CloudNativePG provides two main ways to import objects from the source cluster into the destination cluster: microservice approach : the destination cluster is designed to host a single application database owned by the specified application user, as recommended by the CloudNativePG project monolith approach : the destination cluster is designed to host multiple databases and different users, imported from the source cluster The first import method is available via the microservice type, while the latter by the monolith type. Warning It is your responsibility to ensure that the destination cluster can access the source cluster with a superuser or a user having enough privileges to take a logical backup with pg_dump . Please refer to the PostgreSQL documentation on \"SQL Dump\" for further information. The microservice type With the microservice approach, you can specify a single database you want to import from the source cluster into the destination cluster. The operation is performed in 4 steps: initdb bootstrap of the new cluster export of the selected database (in initdb.import.databases ) using pg_dump -Fd import of the database using pg_restore --no-acl --no-owner into the initdb.database (application database) owned by the initdb.owner user cleanup of the database dump file optional execution of the user defined SQL queries in the application database via the postImportApplicationSQL parameter execution of ANALYZE VERBOSE on the imported database For example, the YAML below creates a new 3 instance PostgreSQL cluster (latest available major version at the time the operator was released) called cluster-microservice that imports the angus database from the cluster-pg96 cluster (with the unsupported PostgreSQL 9.6), by connecting to the postgres database using the postgres user, via the password stored in the cluster-pg96-superuser secret. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-microservice spec: instances: 3 bootstrap: initdb: import: type: microservice databases: - angus source: externalCluster: cluster-pg96 #postImportApplicationSQL: #- | # INSERT YOUR SQL QUERIES HERE storage: size: 1Gi externalClusters: - name: cluster-pg96 connectionParameters: # Use the correct IP or host name for the source database host: pg96.local user: postgres dbname: postgres password: name: cluster-pg96-superuser key: password Warning The example above deliberately uses a source database running a version of PostgreSQL that is not supported anymore by the Community, and consequently by CloudNativePG. Data export from the source instance is performed using the version of pg_dump in the destination cluster, which must be a supported one, and equal or greater than the source one. Based on our experience, this way of exporting data should work on older and unsupported versions of Postgres too, giving you the chance to move your legacy data to a better system, inside Kubernetes. This is the main reason why we used 9.6 in the examples of this section. We'd be interested to hear from you should you experience any issues in this area. There are a few things you need to be aware of when using the microservice type: It requires an externalCluster that points to an existing PostgreSQL instance containing the data to import (for more information, please refer to \"The externalClusters section\" ) Traffic must be allowed between the Kubernetes cluster and the externalCluster during the operation Connection to the source database must be granted with the specified user that needs to run pg_dump and read roles information ( superuser is OK) Currently, the pg_dump -Fd result is stored temporarily inside the dumps folder in the PGDATA volume, so there should be enough available space to temporarily contain the dump result on the assigned node, as well as the restored data and indexes. Once the import operation is completed, this folder is automatically deleted by the operator. Only one database can be specified inside the initdb.import.databases array Roles are not imported - and as such they cannot be specified inside initdb.import.roles The monolith type With the monolith approach, you can specify a set of roles and databases you want to import from the source cluster into the destination cluster. The operation is performed in the following steps: initdb bootstrap of the new cluster export and import of the selected roles export of the selected databases (in initdb.import.databases ), one at a time, using pg_dump -Fd create each of the selected databases and import data using pg_restore run ANALYZE on each imported database cleanup of the database dump files For example, the YAML below creates a new 3 instance PostgreSQL cluster (latest available major version at the time the operator was released) called cluster-monolith that imports the accountant and the bank_user roles, as well as the accounting , banking , resort databases from the cluster-pg96 cluster (with the unsupported PostgreSQL 9.6), by connecting to the postgres database using the postgres user, via the password stored in the cluster-pg96-superuser secret. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-monolith spec: instances: 3 bootstrap: initdb: import: type: monolith databases: - accounting - banking - resort roles: - accountant - bank_user source: externalCluster: cluster-pg96 storage: size: 1Gi externalClusters: - name: cluster-pg96 connectionParameters: # Use the correct IP or host name for the source database host: pg96.local user: postgres dbname: postgres sslmode: require password: name: cluster-pg96-superuser key: password There are a few things you need to be aware of when using the monolith type: It requires an externalCluster that points to an existing PostgreSQL instance containing the data to import (for more information, please refer to \"The externalClusters section\" ) Traffic must be allowed between the Kubernetes cluster and the externalCluster during the operation Connection to the source database must be granted with the specified user that needs to run pg_dump and retrieve roles information ( superuser is OK) Currently, the pg_dump -Fd result is stored temporarily inside the dumps folder in the PGDATA volume, so there should be enough available space to temporarily contain the dump result on the assigned node, as well as the restored data and indexes. Once the import operation is completed, this folder is automatically deleted by the operator. At least one database to be specified in the initdb.import.databases array Any role that is required by the imported databases must be specified inside initdb.import.roles , with the limitations below: The following roles, if present, are not imported: postgres , streaming_replica , cnp_pooler_pgbouncer The SUPERUSER option is removed from any imported role Wildcard \"*\" can be used as the only element in the databases and/or roles arrays to import every object of the kind; When matching databases the wildcard will ignore the postgres database, template databases, and those databases not allowing connections After the clone procedure is done, ANALYZE VERBOSE is executed for every database. postImportApplicationSQL field is not supported Import optimizations During the logical import of a database, CloudNativePG optimizes the configuration of PostgreSQL in order to prioritize speed versus data durability, by forcing: archive_mode to off fsync to off full_page_writes to off max_wal_senders to 0 wal_level to minimal Before completing the import job, CloudNativePG restores the expected configuration, then runs initdb --sync-only to ensure that data is permanently written on disk. Important WAL archiving, if requested, and WAL level will be honored after the database import process has completed. Similarly, replicas will be cloned after the bootstrap phase, when the actual cluster resource starts. There are other optimizations you can do during the import phase. Although this topic is beyond the scope of CloudNativePG, we recommend that you reduce unnecessary writes in the checkpoint area by tuning Postgres GUCs like shared_buffers , max_wal_size , checkpoint_timeout directly in the Cluster configuration. Customizing pg_dump and pg_restore Behavior You can customize the behavior of pg_dump and pg_restore by specifying additional options using the pgDumpExtraOptions and pgRestoreExtraOptions parameters. For instance, you can enable parallel jobs to speed up data import/export processes, as shown in the following example: # <snip> bootstrap: initdb: import: type: microservice databases: - app source: externalCluster: cluster-example pgDumpExtraOptions: - '--jobs=2' pgRestoreExtraOptions: - '--jobs=2' # <snip> Warning Use the pgDumpExtraOptions and pgRestoreExtraOptions fields with caution and at your own risk. These options are not validated or verified by the operator, and some configurations may conflict with its intended functionality or behavior. Always test thoroughly in a safe and controlled environment before applying them in production. Online Import and Upgrades Logical replication offers a powerful way to import any PostgreSQL database accessible over the network using the following approach: Import Bootstrap with Schema-Only Option : Initialize the schema in the target database before replication begins. Subscription Resource : Set up continuous replication to synchronize data changes. This technique can also be leveraged for performing major PostgreSQL upgrades with minimal downtime, making it ideal for seamless migrations and system upgrades.

This default behavior is explained in the \"Bootstrap an Empty Cluster\" section. For more advanced use cases, CloudNativePG introduces declarative database management , which empowers users to define and control the lifecycle of PostgreSQL databases using the Database Custom Resource Definition (CRD). This method seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes, providing a scalable, automated, and consistent approach to managing PostgreSQL databases. Key Concepts Scope of Management Important CloudNativePG manages global objects in PostgreSQL clusters, including databases, roles, and tablespaces. However, it does not manage database content beyond extensions and schemas (e.g., tables). To manage database content, use specialized tools or rely on the applications themselves. Declarative Database Manifest The following example demonstrates how a Database resource interacts with a Cluster : apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Database metadata: name: cluster-example-one spec: name: one owner: app cluster: name: cluster-example extensions: - name: bloom ensure: present When applied, this manifest creates a Database object called cluster-example-one requesting a database named one , owned by the app role, in the cluster-example PostgreSQL cluster. Info Please refer to the API reference the full list of attributes you can define for each Database object. Required Fields in the Database Manifest metadata.name : Unique name of the Kubernetes object within its namespace. spec.name : Name of the database as it will appear in PostgreSQL. spec.owner : PostgreSQL role that owns the database. spec.cluster.name : Name of the target PostgreSQL cluster. The Database object must reference a specific Cluster , determining where the database will be created. It is managed by the cluster's primary instance, ensuring the database is created or updated as needed. Info The distinction between metadata.name and spec.name allows multiple Database resources to reference databases with the same name across different CloudNativePG clusters in the same Kubernetes namespace. Reserved Database Names PostgreSQL automatically creates databases such as postgres , template0 , and template1 . These names are reserved and cannot be used for new Database objects in CloudNativePG. Important Creating a Database with spec.name set to postgres , template0 , or template1 is not allowed. Reconciliation and Status Once a Database object is reconciled successfully: status.applied will be set to true . status.observedGeneration will match the metadata.generation of the last applied configuration. Example of a reconciled Database object: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Database metadata: generation: 1 name: cluster-example-one spec: cluster: name: cluster-example name: one owner: app status: observedGeneration: 1 applied: true If an error occurs during reconciliation, status.applied will be false , and an error message will be included in the status.message field. Deleting a Database CloudNativePG supports two methods for database deletion: Using the delete reclaim policy Declaratively setting the database's ensure field to absent Deleting via delete Reclaim Policy The databaseReclaimPolicy field determines the behavior when a Database object is deleted: retain (default): The database remains in PostgreSQL for manual management. delete : The database is automatically removed from PostgreSQL. Example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Database metadata: name: cluster-example-two spec: databaseReclaimPolicy: delete name: two owner: app cluster: name: cluster-example Deleting this Database object will automatically remove the two database from the cluster-example cluster. Declaratively Setting ensure: absent To remove a database, set the ensure field to absent like in the following example:. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Database metadata: name: cluster-example-database-to-drop spec: cluster: name: cluster-example name: database-to-drop owner: app ensure: absent This manifest ensures that the database-to-drop database is removed from the cluster-example cluster. Managing Extensions in a Database Info While extensions are database-scoped rather than global objects, CloudNativePG provides a declarative interface for managing them. This approach is necessary because installing certain extensions may require superuser privileges, which CloudNativePG recommends disabling by default. By leveraging this API, users can efficiently manage extensions in a scalable and controlled manner without requiring elevated privileges. CloudNativePG simplifies and automates the management of PostgreSQL extensions within the target database. To enable this feature, define the spec.extensions field with a list of extension specifications, as shown in the following example: # ... spec: extensions: - name: bloom ensure: present # ... Each extension entry supports the following properties: name (mandatory) : The name of the extension. ensure : Specifies whether the extension should be present or absent in the database: present : Ensures that the extension is installed (default). absent : Ensures that the extension is removed. version : The specific version of the extension to install or upgrade to. schema : The schema in which the extension should be installed. Info CloudNativePG manages extensions using the following PostgreSQL\u2019s SQL commands: CREATE EXTENSION , DROP EXTENSION , ALTER EXTENSION (limited to UPDATE TO and SET SCHEMA ). The operator reconciles only the extensions explicitly listed in spec.extensions . Any existing extensions not specified in this list remain unchanged. Warning Before the introduction of declarative extension management, CloudNativePG did not offer a straightforward way to create extensions through configuration. To address this, the \"managed extensions\" feature was introduced, enabling the automated and transparent management of key extensions like pg_stat_statements . Currently, it is your responsibility to ensure there are no conflicts between extension support in the Database CRD and the managed extensions feature. Managing Schemas in a Database Info Schema management in PostgreSQL is an exception to CloudNativePG's primary focus on managing global objects. Since schemas exist within a database, they are typically managed as part of the application development process. However, CloudNativePG provides a declarative interface for schema management, primarily to complete the support of extensions deployment within schemas. CloudNativePG simplifies and automates the management of PostgreSQL schemas within the target database. To enable this feature, define the spec.schemas field with a list of schema specifications, as shown in the following example: # ... spec: schemas: - name: app owner: app # ... Each schema entry supports the following properties: name (mandatory) : The name of the schema. owner : The owner of the schema. ensure : Specifies whether the schema should be present or absent in the database: present : Ensures that the schema is installed (default). absent : Ensures that the schema is removed. Info CloudNativePG manages schemas using the following PostgreSQL\u2019s SQL commands: CREATE SCHEMA , DROP SCHEMA , ALTER SCHEMA . Limitations and Caveats Renaming a database While CloudNativePG adheres to PostgreSQL\u2019s CREATE DATABASE and ALTER DATABASE commands, renaming databases is not supported . Attempting to modify spec.name in an existing Database object will result in rejection by Kubernetes. Creating vs. Altering a Database For new databases, CloudNativePG uses the CREATE DATABASE statement. For existing databases, ALTER DATABASE is used to apply changes. It is important to note that there are some differences between these two Postgres commands: in particular, the options accepted by ALTER are a subset of those accepted by CREATE . Warning Some fields, such as encoding and collation settings, are immutable in PostgreSQL. Attempts to modify these fields on existing databases will be ignored. Replica Clusters Database objects declared on replica clusters cannot be enforced, as replicas lack write privileges. These objects will remain in a pending state until the replica is promoted. Conflict Resolution If two Database objects in the same namespace manage the same PostgreSQL database (i.e., identical spec.name and spec.cluster.name ), the second object will be rejected. Example status message: status: applied: false message: 'reconciliation error: database \"one\" is already managed by Database object \"cluster-example-one\"' Postgres Version Differences CloudNativePG adheres to PostgreSQL's capabilities. For example, features like ICU_RULES introduced in PostgreSQL 16 are unavailable in earlier versions. Errors from PostgreSQL will be reflected in the Database object's status . Manual Changes CloudNativePG does not overwrite manual changes to databases. Once reconciled, a Database object will not be reapplied unless its metadata.generation changes, giving flexibility for direct PostgreSQL modifications.","title":"PostgreSQL Database Management"},{"location":"declarative_database_management/#postgresql-database-management","text":"CloudNativePG simplifies PostgreSQL database provisioning by automatically creating an application database named app by default.

With the managed stanza in the cluster spec, CloudNativePG now provides full lifecycle management for roles specified in .spec.managed.roles . This feature enables declarative management of existing roles, as well as the creation of new roles if they are not already present in the database. Role creation will occur after the database bootstrapping is complete. An example manifest for a cluster with declarative role management can be found in the file cluster-example-with-roles.yaml . Here is an excerpt from that file: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster spec: managed: roles: - name: dante ensure: present comment: Dante Alighieri login: true superuser: false inRoles: - pg_monitor - pg_signal_backend The role specification in .spec.managed.roles adheres to the PostgreSQL structure and naming conventions . Please refer to the API reference for the full list of attributes you can define for each role. A few points are worth noting: The ensure attribute is not part of PostgreSQL. It enables declarative role management to create and remove roles. The two possible values are present (the default) and absent . The inherit attribute is true by default, following PostgreSQL conventions. The connectionLimit attribute defaults to -1, in line with PostgreSQL conventions. Role membership with inRoles defaults to no memberships. Declarative role management ensures that PostgreSQL instances align with the spec. If a user modifies role attributes directly in the database, the CloudNativePG operator will revert those changes during the next reconciliation cycle. Password management The declarative role management feature includes reconciling of role passwords. Passwords are managed in fundamentally different ways in the Kubernetes world and in PostgreSQL, and as a result there are a few things to note. Managed role configurations may optionally specify the name of a Secret where the username and password are stored (encoded in Base64 as is usual in Kubernetes). For example: managed: roles: - name: dante ensure: present [\u2026 snipped \u2026] passwordSecret: name: cluster-example-dante This would assume the existence of a Secret called cluster-example-dante , containing a username and password. The username should match the role we are setting the password for. For example, : apiVersion: v1 data: username: ZGFudGU= password: ZGFudGU= kind: Secret metadata: name: cluster-example-dante labels: cnpg.io/reload: \"true\" type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth If there is no passwordSecret specified for a role, the instance manager will not try to CREATE / ALTER the role with a password. This keeps with PostgreSQL conventions, where ALTER will not update passwords unless directed to with WITH PASSWORD . If a role was initially created with a password, and we would like to set the password to NULL in PostgreSQL, this necessitates being explicit on the part of the user of CloudNativePG. To distinguish \"no password provided in spec\" from \"set the password to NULL\", the field DisablePassword should be used. Imagine we decided we would like to have no password on the dante role in the database. In such case we would specify the following: managed: roles: - name: dante ensure: present [\u2026 snipped \u2026] disablePassword: true NOTE: it is considered an error to set both passwordSecret and disablePassword on a given role. This configuration will be rejected by the validation webhook. Password expiry, VALID UNTIL The VALID UNTIL role attribute in PostgreSQL controls password expiry. Roles created without VALID UNTIL specified get NULL by default in PostgreSQL, meaning that their password will never expire. PostgreSQL uses a timestamp type for VALID UNTIL , which includes support for the value 'infinity' indicating that the password never expires. Please see the PostgreSQL documentation for reference. With declarative role management, the validUntil attribute for managed roles controls password expiry. validUntil can only take: a Kubernetes timestamp, or be omitted (defaulting to null ) In the first case, the given validUntil timestamp will be set in the database as the VALID UNTIL attribute of the role. In the second case (omitted validUntil ) the operator will ensure password never expires, mirroring the behavior of PostgreSQL. Specifically: in case of new role, it will omit the VALID UNTIL clause in the role creation statement in case of existing role, it will set VALID UNTIL to infinity if VALID UNTIL was not set to NULL in the database (this is due to PostgreSQL not allowing VALID UNTIL NULL in the ALTER ROLE SQL statement) Warning New roles created without passwordSecret will have a NULL password inside PostgreSQL. Password hashed You can also provide pre-encrypted passwords by specifying the password in MD5/SCRAM-SHA-256 hash format: kind: Secret type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth metadata: name: cluster-example-cavalcanti labels: cnpg.io/reload: \"true\" apiVersion: v1 stringData: username: cavalcanti password: SCRAM-SHA-256$<iteration count>:<salt>$<StoredKey>:<ServerKey> Unrealizable role configurations In PostgreSQL, in some cases, commands cannot be honored by the database and will be rejected. Please refer to the PostgreSQL documentation on error codes for details. Role operations can produce such fundamental errors. Two examples: We ask PostgreSQL to create the role petrarca as a member of the role (group) poets , but poets does not exist. We ask PostgreSQL to drop the role dante , but the role dante is the owner of the database inferno . These fundamental errors cannot be fixed by the database, nor the CloudNativePG operator, without clarification from the human administrator. The two examples above could be fixed by creating the role poets or dropping the database inferno respectively, but they might have originated due to human error, and in such case, the \"fix\" proposed might be the wrong thing to do. CloudNativePG will record when such fundamental errors occur, and will display them in the cluster Status. Which segues into\u2026 Status of managed roles The Cluster status includes a section for the managed roles' status, as shown below: status: [\u2026snipped\u2026] managedRolesStatus: byStatus: not-managed: - app pending-reconciliation: - dante - petrarca reconciled: - ariosto reserved: - postgres - streaming_replica cannotReconcile: dante: - 'could not perform DELETE on role dante: owner of database inferno' petrarca: - 'could not perform UPDATE_MEMBERSHIPS on role petrarca: role \"poets\" does not exist' Note the special sub-section cannotReconcile for operations the database (and CloudNativePG) cannot honor, and which require human intervention. This section covers roles reserved for operator use and those that are not under declarative management, providing a comprehensive view of the roles in the database instances. The kubectl plugin also shows the status of managed roles in its status sub-command: Managed roles status Status Roles ------ ----- pending-reconciliation petrarca reconciled app,dante reserved postgres,streaming_replica Irreconcilable roles Role Errors ---- ------ petrarca could not perform UPDATE_MEMBERSHIPS on role petrarca: role \"poets\" does not exist Important In terms of backward compatibility, declarative role management is designed to ignore roles that exist in the database but are not included in the spec.

Why do you say the contrary? An independent research survey commissioned by the Data on Kubernetes Community in September 2021 revealed that half of the respondents run most of their production workloads on Kubernetes. 90% of them believe that Kubernetes is ready for stateful workloads, and 70% of them run databases in production. Databases like Postgres. However, according to them, significant challenges remain, such as the knowledge gap (Kubernetes and Cloud Native, in general, have a steep learning curve) and the quality of Kubernetes operators. The latter is the reason why we believe that an operator like CloudNativePG highly contributes to the success of your project. For database fanatics like us, a real game-changer has been the introduction of the support for local persistent volumes in Kubernetes 1.14 in April 2019 . CloudNativePG is built on immutable application containers. What does it mean? According to the microservice architectural pattern, a container is designed to run a single application or process. As a result, such container images are built to run the main application as the single entry point (the so-called PID 1 process). In Kubernetes terms, the application is referred to as workload. Workloads can be stateless like a web application server or stateful like a database. Mapping this concept to PostgreSQL, an immutable application container is a single \"postgres\" process that is running and tied to a single and specific version - the one in the immutable container image. No other processes such as SSH or systemd, or syslog are allowed. Immutable Application Containers are in contrast with Mutable System Containers, which are still a very common way to interpret and use containers. Immutable means that a container won't be modified during its life: no updates, no patches, no configuration changes. If you must update the application code or apply a patch, you build a new image and redeploy it. Immutability makes deployments safer and more repeatable. For more information, please refer to \"Why EDB chose immutable application containers\" . What does Cloud Native mean? The Cloud Native Computing Foundation defines the term \" Cloud Native \". However, since the start of the Cloud Native PostgreSQL/CloudNativePG operator at 2ndQuadrant, the development team has been interpreting Cloud Native as three main concepts: An existing, healthy, genuine, and prosperous DevOps culture, founded on people, as well as principles and processes, which enables teams and organizations (as teams of teams) to continuously change so to innovate and accelerate the delivery of outcomes and produce value for the business in safer, more efficient, and more engaging ways A microservice architecture that is based on Immutable Application Containers A way to manage and orchestrate these containers, such as Kubernetes Currently, the standard de facto for container orchestration is Kubernetes, which automates the deployment, administration and scalability of Cloud Native Applications. Another definition of Cloud Native that resonates with us is the one defined by Ibryam and Hu\u00df in \"Kubernetes Patterns\", published by O'Reilly : Principles, Patterns, Tools to automate containerized microservices at scale Can I run CloudNativePG on bare metal Kubernetes? Yes, definitely. You can run Kubernetes on bare metal. And you can dedicate one or more physical worker nodes with locally attached storage to PostgreSQL workloads for maximum and predictable I/O performance. The actual Cloud Native PostgreSQL project, from which CloudNativePG originated, was born after a pilot project in 2019 that benchmarked storage and PostgreSQL on the same bare metal server, first directly in Linux, and then inside Kubernetes. As expected, the experiment showed only negligible performance impact introduced by the container running in Kubernetes through local persistent volumes, allowing the Cloud Native initiative to continue. Why should I use PostgreSQL replication instead of file system replication? Please read the \"Architecture: Synchronizing the state\" section. Why should I use an operator instead of running PostgreSQL as a container? The most basic approach to running PostgreSQL in Kubernetes is to have a pod, which is the smallest unit of deployment in Kubernetes, running a Postgres container with no replica. The volume hosting the Postgres data directory is mounted on the pod, and it usually resides on network storage. In this case, Kubernetes restarts the pod in case of a problem or moves it to another Kubernetes node. The most sophisticated approach is to run PostgreSQL using an operator. An operator is an extension of the Kubernetes controller and defines how a complex application works in business continuity contexts. The operator pattern is currently state of the art in Kubernetes for this purpose. An operator simulates the work of a human operator in an automated and programmatic way. Postgres is a complex application, and an operator not only needs to deploy a cluster (the first step), but also properly react after unexpected events. The typical example is that of a failover. An operator relies on Kubernetes for capabilities like self-healing, scalability, replication, high availability, backup, recovery, updates, access, resource control, storage management, and so on. It also facilitates the integration of a PostgreSQL cluster in the log management and monitoring infrastructure. CloudNativePG enables the definition of the desired state of a PostgreSQL cluster via declarative configuration. Kubernetes continuously makes sure that the current state of the infrastructure matches the desired one through reconciliation loops initiated by the Kubernetes controller. If the desired state and the actual state don't match, reconciliation loops trigger self-healing procedures. That's where an operator like CloudNativePG comes into play. Are there any other operators for Postgres out there? Yes, of course. And our advice is that you look at all of them and compare them with CloudNativePG before making your decision. You will see that most of these operators use an external failover management tool (Patroni or similar) and rely on StatefulSets. Here is a non exhaustive list, in chronological order from their publication on GitHub: Crunchy Data Postgres Operator (2017) Zalando Postgres Operator (2017) Stackgres (2020) Percona Operator for PostgreSQL (2021) Kubegres (2021) Feel free to report any relevant missing entry as a PR. Info The Data on Kubernetes Community (which includes some of our maintainers) is working on an independent and vendor neutral project to list the operators called Operator Feature Matrix . You say that CloudNativePG is a fully declarative operator. What do you mean by that? The easiest way is to explain declarative configuration through an example that highlights the differences with imperative configuration. In an imperative context, the state is defined as a series of tasks to be executed in sequence. So, we can get a three-node PostgreSQL cluster by creating the first instance, configuring the replication, cloning a second instance, and the third one. In a declarative approach, the state of a system is defined using configuration, namely: there's a PostgreSQL 13 cluster with two replicas. This approach highly simplifies change management operations, and when these are stored in source control systems like Git, it enables the Infrastructure as Code capability. And Kubernetes takes it farther than deployment, as it makes sure that our request is fulfilled at any time. What are the required skills to run PostgreSQL on Kubernetes? Running PostgreSQL on Kubernetes requires both PostgreSQL and Kubernetes skills in your DevOps team. The best experience is when database administrators familiarize themselves with Kubernetes core concepts and are able to interact with Kubernetes administrators. Our advice is for everyone that wants to fully exploit Cloud Native PostgreSQL to acquire the \"Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)\" status from the CNCF certification program. Why isn't CloudNativePG using StatefulSets? CloudNativePG does not rely on StatefulSet resources, and instead manages the underlying PVCs directly by leveraging the selected storage class for dynamic provisioning. Please refer to the \"Custom Pod Controller\" section for details and reasons behind this decision. High availability What happens to the PostgreSQL clusters when the operator pod dies or it is not available for a certain amount of time? The CloudNativePG operator, among other things, is responsible for self-healing capabilities. As such, they might not be available during an outage of the operator. However, assuming that the outage does not affect the nodes where PostgreSQL clusters are running, the database will continue to serve normal operations, through the relevant Kubernetes services. Moreover, the instance manager , which runs inside each PostgreSQL pod will still work, making sure that the database server is up, including accessory services like logging, export of metrics, continuous archiving of WAL files, etc. To summarize: an outage of the operator does not necessarily imply a PostgreSQL database outage; it's like running a database without a DBA or system administrator. What are the reasons behind CloudNativePG not relying on a failover management tool like Patroni, repmgr, or Stolon? Although part of the team that develops CloudNativePG has been heavily involved in repmgr in the past, we decided to take a different approach and directly extend the Kubernetes controller and rely on the Kubernetes API server to hold the status of a Postgres cluster, and use it as the only source of truth to: control High Availability of a Postgres cluster primarily via automated failover and switchover, coordinating itself with the instance manager control the Kubernetes services, that is the entry points for your applications Should I manually resync a former primary with the new one following a failover? No. The operator does that automatically for you, and relies on pg_rewind to synchronize the former primary with the new one. Database management Why should I use PostgreSQL? We believe that PostgreSQL is the equivalent in the database area of what Linux represents in the operating system space. The current latest major version of Postgres is version 16, which ships out of the box: native streaming replication, both physical and logical continuous hot backup and point in time recovery declarative partitioning for horizontal table partitioning, which is a very well-known technique in the database area to improve vertical scalability on a single instance extensibility, with extensions like PostGIS for geographical databases parallel queries for vertical scalability JSON support, unleashing the multi-model hybrid database for both structured and unstructured data queried via standard SQL And so on ... How many databases should be hosted in a single PostgreSQL instance? Our recommendation is to dedicate a single PostgreSQL cluster (intended as primary and multiple standby servers) to a single database, entirely managed by a single microservice application. However, by leveraging the \"postgres\" superuser, it is possible to create as many users and databases as desired (subject to the available resources). The reason for this recommendation lies in the Cloud Native concept, based on microservices. In a pure microservice architecture, the microservice itself should own the data it manages exclusively. These could be flat files, queues, key-value stores, or, in our case, a PostgreSQL relational database containing both structured and unstructured data. The general idea is that only the microservice can access the database, including schema management and migrations. CloudNativePG has been designed to work this way out of the box, by default creating an application user and an application database owned by the aforementioned application user. Reserving a PostgreSQL instance to a single microservice owned database, enhances: resource management: in PostgreSQL, CPU, and memory constrained resources are generally handled at the instance level, not the database level, making it easier to integrate it with Kubernetes resource management policies at the pod level physical continuous backup and Point-In-Time-Recovery (PITR): given that PostgreSQL handles continuous backup and recovery at the instance level, having one database per instance simplifies PITR operations, differentiates retention policy management, and increases data protection of backups application updates: enable each application to decide their update policies without impacting other databases owned by different applications database updates: each application can decide which PostgreSQL version to use, and independently, when to upgrade to a different major version of PostgreSQL and at what conditions (e.g., cutover time) Is there an upper limit in database size for not considering Kubernetes? No, as Kubernetes is no different from virtual machines and bare metal as far as this is regarded. Practically, however, it depends on the available resources of your Kubernetes cluster. Our advice with very large databases (VLDB) is to consider a shared nothing architecture, where a Kubernetes worker node is dedicated to a single Postgres instance, with dedicated storage. We proved that this extreme architectural pattern works when we benchmarked running PostgreSQL on bare metal Kubernetes with local persistent volumes . Tablespaces and horizontal partitioning are data modeling techniques that you can use to improve the vertical scalability of you databases. How can I specify a time zone in the PostgreSQL cluster? PostgreSQL has an extensive support for time zones, as explained in the official documentation: Date time data types Client connections config options Although time zones can even be used at session, transaction and even as part of a query in PostgreSQL, a very common way is to set them up globally. With CloudNativePG you can configure the cluster level time zone in the .spec.postgresql.parameters section as in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: pg-italy spec: instances: 1 postgresql: parameters: timezone: \"Europe/Rome\" storage: size: 1Gi The time zone can be verified with: $ kubectl exec -ti pg-italy-1 -c postgres -- psql -x -c \"SHOW timezone\" -[ RECORD 1 ]--------- TimeZone | Europe/Rome What is the recommended architecture for best business continuity outcomes? As covered in the \"Architecture\" section, the main recommendation is to adopt shared nothing architectures as much as possible, by leveraging the native capabilities and resources that Kubernetes provides in a single cluster, namely: availability zones: spread your instances across different availability zones in the same Kubernetes cluster worker nodes: as a consequence, make sure that your Postgres instances reside on different Kubernetes worker nodes storage: use dedicated storage for each worker node running Postgres Use at least one standby, preferably at least two, so that you can configure synchronous replication in the cluster, introducing RPO =0 for high availability. If you do not have availability zones - normally the case of on-premise installations - separate on worker nodes and storage. Properly setup continuous backup on a local/regional object store. The same architecture that is in a single Kubernetes cluster can be replicated in another Kubernetes cluster (normally in another geographical area or region) through the replica cluster feature, providing disaster recovery and high availability at global scale. You can use the WAL archive in the primary object store to feed the replica in the other region, without having to provide a streaming connection, if the default maximum RPO of 5 minutes is enough for you. How can instances be stopped or started? Please look at \"Fencing\" or \"Hibernation\" . What are the global objects such as roles and databases that are automatically created by CloudNativePG? The operator automatically creates a user for the application (by default called app ) and a database for the application (by default called app ) which is owned by the aforementioned user. This way, the database is ready for a microservice adoption, as developers can control migrations using the app user, without requiring superuser access.

An independent research survey commissioned by the Data on Kubernetes Community in September 2021 revealed that half of the respondents run most of their production workloads on Kubernetes. 90% of them believe that Kubernetes is ready for stateful workloads, and 70% of them run databases in production. Databases like Postgres. However, according to them, significant challenges remain, such as the knowledge gap (Kubernetes and Cloud Native, in general, have a steep learning curve) and the quality of Kubernetes operators. The latter is the reason why we believe that an operator like CloudNativePG highly contributes to the success of your project. For database fanatics like us, a real game-changer has been the introduction of the support for local persistent volumes in Kubernetes 1.14 in April 2019 . CloudNativePG is built on immutable application containers. What does it mean? According to the microservice architectural pattern, a container is designed to run a single application or process. As a result, such container images are built to run the main application as the single entry point (the so-called PID 1 process). In Kubernetes terms, the application is referred to as workload. Workloads can be stateless like a web application server or stateful like a database. Mapping this concept to PostgreSQL, an immutable application container is a single \"postgres\" process that is running and tied to a single and specific version - the one in the immutable container image. No other processes such as SSH or systemd, or syslog are allowed. Immutable Application Containers are in contrast with Mutable System Containers, which are still a very common way to interpret and use containers. Immutable means that a container won't be modified during its life: no updates, no patches, no configuration changes. If you must update the application code or apply a patch, you build a new image and redeploy it. Immutability makes deployments safer and more repeatable. For more information, please refer to \"Why EDB chose immutable application containers\" . What does Cloud Native mean? The Cloud Native Computing Foundation defines the term \" Cloud Native \". However, since the start of the Cloud Native PostgreSQL/CloudNativePG operator at 2ndQuadrant, the development team has been interpreting Cloud Native as three main concepts: An existing, healthy, genuine, and prosperous DevOps culture, founded on people, as well as principles and processes, which enables teams and organizations (as teams of teams) to continuously change so to innovate and accelerate the delivery of outcomes and produce value for the business in safer, more efficient, and more engaging ways A microservice architecture that is based on Immutable Application Containers A way to manage and orchestrate these containers, such as Kubernetes Currently, the standard de facto for container orchestration is Kubernetes, which automates the deployment, administration and scalability of Cloud Native Applications. Another definition of Cloud Native that resonates with us is the one defined by Ibryam and Hu\u00df in \"Kubernetes Patterns\", published by O'Reilly : Principles, Patterns, Tools to automate containerized microservices at scale Can I run CloudNativePG on bare metal Kubernetes? Yes, definitely. You can run Kubernetes on bare metal. And you can dedicate one or more physical worker nodes with locally attached storage to PostgreSQL workloads for maximum and predictable I/O performance. The actual Cloud Native PostgreSQL project, from which CloudNativePG originated, was born after a pilot project in 2019 that benchmarked storage and PostgreSQL on the same bare metal server, first directly in Linux, and then inside Kubernetes. As expected, the experiment showed only negligible performance impact introduced by the container running in Kubernetes through local persistent volumes, allowing the Cloud Native initiative to continue. Why should I use PostgreSQL replication instead of file system replication? Please read the \"Architecture: Synchronizing the state\" section. Why should I use an operator instead of running PostgreSQL as a container? The most basic approach to running PostgreSQL in Kubernetes is to have a pod, which is the smallest unit of deployment in Kubernetes, running a Postgres container with no replica. The volume hosting the Postgres data directory is mounted on the pod, and it usually resides on network storage. In this case, Kubernetes restarts the pod in case of a problem or moves it to another Kubernetes node. The most sophisticated approach is to run PostgreSQL using an operator. An operator is an extension of the Kubernetes controller and defines how a complex application works in business continuity contexts. The operator pattern is currently state of the art in Kubernetes for this purpose. An operator simulates the work of a human operator in an automated and programmatic way. Postgres is a complex application, and an operator not only needs to deploy a cluster (the first step), but also properly react after unexpected events. The typical example is that of a failover. An operator relies on Kubernetes for capabilities like self-healing, scalability, replication, high availability, backup, recovery, updates, access, resource control, storage management, and so on. It also facilitates the integration of a PostgreSQL cluster in the log management and monitoring infrastructure. CloudNativePG enables the definition of the desired state of a PostgreSQL cluster via declarative configuration. Kubernetes continuously makes sure that the current state of the infrastructure matches the desired one through reconciliation loops initiated by the Kubernetes controller. If the desired state and the actual state don't match, reconciliation loops trigger self-healing procedures. That's where an operator like CloudNativePG comes into play. Are there any other operators for Postgres out there? Yes, of course. And our advice is that you look at all of them and compare them with CloudNativePG before making your decision. You will see that most of these operators use an external failover management tool (Patroni or similar) and rely on StatefulSets. Here is a non exhaustive list, in chronological order from their publication on GitHub: Crunchy Data Postgres Operator (2017) Zalando Postgres Operator (2017) Stackgres (2020) Percona Operator for PostgreSQL (2021) Kubegres (2021) Feel free to report any relevant missing entry as a PR. Info The Data on Kubernetes Community (which includes some of our maintainers) is working on an independent and vendor neutral project to list the operators called Operator Feature Matrix . You say that CloudNativePG is a fully declarative operator. What do you mean by that? The easiest way is to explain declarative configuration through an example that highlights the differences with imperative configuration. In an imperative context, the state is defined as a series of tasks to be executed in sequence. So, we can get a three-node PostgreSQL cluster by creating the first instance, configuring the replication, cloning a second instance, and the third one. In a declarative approach, the state of a system is defined using configuration, namely: there's a PostgreSQL 13 cluster with two replicas. This approach highly simplifies change management operations, and when these are stored in source control systems like Git, it enables the Infrastructure as Code capability. And Kubernetes takes it farther than deployment, as it makes sure that our request is fulfilled at any time. What are the required skills to run PostgreSQL on Kubernetes? Running PostgreSQL on Kubernetes requires both PostgreSQL and Kubernetes skills in your DevOps team. The best experience is when database administrators familiarize themselves with Kubernetes core concepts and are able to interact with Kubernetes administrators. Our advice is for everyone that wants to fully exploit Cloud Native PostgreSQL to acquire the \"Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)\" status from the CNCF certification program. Why isn't CloudNativePG using StatefulSets? CloudNativePG does not rely on StatefulSet resources, and instead manages the underlying PVCs directly by leveraging the selected storage class for dynamic provisioning. Please refer to the \"Custom Pod Controller\" section for details and reasons behind this decision.","title":"Running PostgreSQL in Kubernetes"},{"location":"faq/#high-availability","text":"What happens to the PostgreSQL clusters when the operator pod dies or it is not available for a certain amount of time? The CloudNativePG operator, among other things, is responsible for self-healing capabilities. As such, they might not be available during an outage of the operator. However, assuming that the outage does not affect the nodes where PostgreSQL clusters are running, the database will continue to serve normal operations, through the relevant Kubernetes services. Moreover, the instance manager , which runs inside each PostgreSQL pod will still work, making sure that the database server is up, including accessory services like logging, export of metrics, continuous archiving of WAL files, etc. To summarize: an outage of the operator does not necessarily imply a PostgreSQL database outage; it's like running a database without a DBA or system administrator. What are the reasons behind CloudNativePG not relying on a failover management tool like Patroni, repmgr, or Stolon? Although part of the team that develops CloudNativePG has been heavily involved in repmgr in the past, we decided to take a different approach and directly extend the Kubernetes controller and rely on the Kubernetes API server to hold the status of a Postgres cluster, and use it as the only source of truth to: control High Availability of a Postgres cluster primarily via automated failover and switchover, coordinating itself with the instance manager control the Kubernetes services, that is the entry points for your applications Should I manually resync a former primary with the new one following a failover? No. The operator does that automatically for you, and relies on pg_rewind to synchronize the former primary with the new one.","title":"High availability"},{"location":"faq/#database-management","text":"Why should I use PostgreSQL? We believe that PostgreSQL is the equivalent in the database area of what Linux represents in the operating system space. The current latest major version of Postgres is version 16, which ships out of the box: native streaming replication, both physical and logical continuous hot backup and point in time recovery declarative partitioning for horizontal table partitioning, which is a very well-known technique in the database area to improve vertical scalability on a single instance extensibility, with extensions like PostGIS for geographical databases parallel queries for vertical scalability JSON support, unleashing the multi-model hybrid database for both structured and unstructured data queried via standard SQL And so on ... How many databases should be hosted in a single PostgreSQL instance? Our recommendation is to dedicate a single PostgreSQL cluster (intended as primary and multiple standby servers) to a single database, entirely managed by a single microservice application. However, by leveraging the \"postgres\" superuser, it is possible to create as many users and databases as desired (subject to the available resources). The reason for this recommendation lies in the Cloud Native concept, based on microservices. In a pure microservice architecture, the microservice itself should own the data it manages exclusively. These could be flat files, queues, key-value stores, or, in our case, a PostgreSQL relational database containing both structured and unstructured data. The general idea is that only the microservice can access the database, including schema management and migrations. CloudNativePG has been designed to work this way out of the box, by default creating an application user and an application database owned by the aforementioned application user. Reserving a PostgreSQL instance to a single microservice owned database, enhances: resource management: in PostgreSQL, CPU, and memory constrained resources are generally handled at the instance level, not the database level, making it easier to integrate it with Kubernetes resource management policies at the pod level physical continuous backup and Point-In-Time-Recovery (PITR): given that PostgreSQL handles continuous backup and recovery at the instance level, having one database per instance simplifies PITR operations, differentiates retention policy management, and increases data protection of backups application updates: enable each application to decide their update policies without impacting other databases owned by different applications database updates: each application can decide which PostgreSQL version to use, and independently, when to upgrade to a different major version of PostgreSQL and at what conditions (e.g., cutover time) Is there an upper limit in database size for not considering Kubernetes? No, as Kubernetes is no different from virtual machines and bare metal as far as this is regarded. Practically, however, it depends on the available resources of your Kubernetes cluster. Our advice with very large databases (VLDB) is to consider a shared nothing architecture, where a Kubernetes worker node is dedicated to a single Postgres instance, with dedicated storage. We proved that this extreme architectural pattern works when we benchmarked running PostgreSQL on bare metal Kubernetes with local persistent volumes . Tablespaces and horizontal partitioning are data modeling techniques that you can use to improve the vertical scalability of you databases. How can I specify a time zone in the PostgreSQL cluster? PostgreSQL has an extensive support for time zones, as explained in the official documentation: Date time data types Client connections config options Although time zones can even be used at session, transaction and even as part of a query in PostgreSQL, a very common way is to set them up globally. With CloudNativePG you can configure the cluster level time zone in the .spec.postgresql.parameters section as in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: pg-italy spec: instances: 1 postgresql: parameters: timezone: \"Europe/Rome\" storage: size: 1Gi The time zone can be verified with: $ kubectl exec -ti pg-italy-1 -c postgres -- psql -x -c \"SHOW timezone\" -[ RECORD 1 ]--------- TimeZone | Europe/Rome What is the recommended architecture for best business continuity outcomes? As covered in the \"Architecture\" section, the main recommendation is to adopt shared nothing architectures as much as possible, by leveraging the native capabilities and resources that Kubernetes provides in a single cluster, namely: availability zones: spread your instances across different availability zones in the same Kubernetes cluster worker nodes: as a consequence, make sure that your Postgres instances reside on different Kubernetes worker nodes storage: use dedicated storage for each worker node running Postgres Use at least one standby, preferably at least two, so that you can configure synchronous replication in the cluster, introducing RPO =0 for high availability. If you do not have availability zones - normally the case of on-premise installations - separate on worker nodes and storage. Properly setup continuous backup on a local/regional object store. The same architecture that is in a single Kubernetes cluster can be replicated in another Kubernetes cluster (normally in another geographical area or region) through the replica cluster feature, providing disaster recovery and high availability at global scale. You can use the WAL archive in the primary object store to feed the replica in the other region, without having to provide a streaming connection, if the default maximum RPO of 5 minutes is enough for you. How can instances be stopped or started? Please look at \"Fencing\" or \"Hibernation\" . What are the global objects such as roles and databases that are automatically created by CloudNativePG? The operator automatically creates a user for the application (by default called app ) and a database for the application (by default called app ) which is owned by the aforementioned user. This way, the database is ready for a microservice adoption, as developers can control migrations using the app user, without requiring superuser access. Teams can then create another user for read-write operations through the \"Declarative role management\" feature and assign the required GRANT to the tables.","title":"Database management"},{"location":"fencing/","text":"Fencing Fencing in CloudNativePG is the ultimate process of protecting the data in one, more, or even all instances of a PostgreSQL cluster when they appear to be malfunctioning.

Using the Helm Chart The operator can be installed using the provided Helm chart . Using OLM CloudNativePG can also be installed via the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) directly from OperatorHub.io . For deployments on Red Hat OpenShift, EDB offers and fully supports a certified version of CloudNativePG, available through the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform . Details about the deployment In Kubernetes, the operator is by default installed in the cnpg-system namespace as a Kubernetes Deployment . The name of this deployment depends on the installation method. When installed through the manifest or the cnpg plugin, it is called cnpg-controller-manager by default. When installed via Helm, the default name is cnpg-cloudnative-pg . Note With Helm you can customize the name of the deployment via the fullnameOverride field in the \"values.yaml\" file . You can get more information using the describe command in kubectl : $ kubectl get deployments -n cnpg-system NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE <deployment-name> 1/1 1 1 18m kubectl describe deploy \\ -n cnpg-system \\ <deployment-name> As with any Deployment, it sits on top of a ReplicaSet and supports rolling upgrades. The default configuration of the CloudNativePG operator comes with a Deployment of a single replica, which is suitable for most installations. In case the node where the pod is running is not reachable anymore, the pod will be rescheduled on another node. If you require high availability at the operator level, it is possible to specify multiple replicas in the Deployment configuration - given that the operator supports leader election. Also, you can take advantage of taints and tolerations to make sure that the operator does not run on the same nodes where the actual PostgreSQL clusters are running (this might even include the control plane for self-managed Kubernetes installations). Operator configuration You can change the default behavior of the operator by overriding some default options. For more information, please refer to the \"Operator configuration\" section. Upgrades Important Please carefully read the release notes before performing an upgrade as some versions might require extra steps. Upgrading CloudNativePG operator is a two-step process: upgrade the controller and the related Kubernetes resources upgrade the instance manager running in every PostgreSQL pod Unless differently stated in the release notes, the first step is normally done by applying the manifest of the newer version for plain Kubernetes installations, or using the native package manager of the used distribution (please follow the instructions in the above sections). The second step is automatically triggered after updating the controller. By default, this initiates a rolling update of every deployed PostgreSQL cluster, upgrading one instance at a time to use the new instance manager. The rolling update concludes with a switchover, which is governed by the primaryUpdateStrategy option. The default value, unsupervised , completes the switchover automatically. If set to supervised , the user must manually promote the new primary instance using the cnpg plugin for kubectl . Rolling updates This process is discussed in-depth on the Rolling Updates page. Important In case primaryUpdateStrategy is set to the default value of unsupervised , an upgrade of the operator will trigger a switchover on your PostgreSQL cluster, causing a (normally negligible) downtime. If your PostgreSQL Cluster has only one instance, the instance will be automatically restarted as supervised value is not supported for primaryUpdateStrategy . In either case, your applications will have to reconnect to PostgreSQL. The default rolling update behavior can be replaced with in-place updates of the instance manager. This approach does not require a restart of the PostgreSQL instance, thereby avoiding a switchover within the cluster. This feature, which is disabled by default, is described in detail below. Spread Upgrades By default, all PostgreSQL clusters are rolled out simultaneously, which may lead to a spike in resource usage, especially when managing multiple clusters. CloudNativePG provides two configuration options at the operator level that allow you to introduce delays between cluster roll-outs or even between instances within the same cluster, helping to distribute resource usage over time: CLUSTERS_ROLLOUT_DELAY : Defines the number of seconds to wait between roll-outs of different PostgreSQL clusters (default: 0 ). INSTANCES_ROLLOUT_DELAY : Defines the number of seconds to wait between roll-outs of individual instances within the same PostgreSQL cluster (default: 0 ). In-place updates of the instance manager By default, CloudNativePG issues a rolling update of the cluster every time the operator is updated. The new instance manager shipped with the operator is added to each PostgreSQL pod via an init container. However, this behavior can be changed via configuration to enable in-place updates of the instance manager, which is the PID 1 process that keeps the container alive. Internally, each instance manager in CloudNativePG supports the injection of a new executable that replaces the existing one after successfully completing an integrity verification phase and gracefully terminating all internal processes. Upon restarting with the new binary, the instance manager seamlessly adopts the already running postmaster . As a result, the PostgreSQL process is unaffected by the update, refraining from the need to perform a switchover. The other side of the coin, is that the Pod is changed after the start, breaking the pure concept of immutability. You can enable this feature by setting the ENABLE_INSTANCE_MANAGER_INPLACE_UPDATES environment variable to 'true' in the operator configuration . The in-place upgrade process will not change the init container image inside the Pods. Therefore, the Pod definition will not reflect the current version of the operator. Compatibility among versions CloudNativePG follows semantic versioning. Every release of the operator within the same API version is compatible with the previous one. The current API version is v1, corresponding to versions 1.x.y of the operator. In addition to new features, new versions of the operator contain bug fixes and stability enhancements. Because of this, we strongly encourage users to upgrade to the latest version of the operator , as each version is released in order to maintain the most secure and stable Postgres environment. CloudNativePG currently releases new versions of the operator at least monthly. If you are unable to apply updates as each version becomes available, we recommend upgrading through each version in sequential order to come current periodically and not skipping versions. The release notes page contains a detailed list of the changes introduced in every released version of CloudNativePG, and it must be read before upgrading to a newer version of the software. Most versions are directly upgradable and in that case, applying the newer manifest for plain Kubernetes installations or using the native package manager of the chosen distribution is enough. When versions are not directly upgradable, the old version needs to be removed before installing the new one. This won't affect user data but only the operator itself. Upgrading to 1.25 from a previous minor version Warning Every time you are upgrading to a higher minor release, make sure you go through the release notes and upgrade instructions of all the intermediate minor releases. For example, if you want to move from 1.23.x to 1.25, make sure you go through the release notes and upgrade instructions for 1.24 and 1.25. No changes to existing 1.24 cluster configurations are required when upgrading to 1.25. Upgrading to 1.24 from a previous minor version From Replica Clusters to Distributed Topology One of the key enhancements in CloudNativePG 1.24.0 is the upgrade of the replica cluster feature. The former replica cluster feature, now referred to as the \"Standalone Replica Cluster,\" is no longer recommended for Disaster Recovery (DR) and High Availability (HA) scenarios that span multiple Kubernetes clusters. Standalone replica clusters are best suited for read-only workloads, such as reporting, OLAP, or creating development environments with test data. For DR and HA purposes, CloudNativePG now introduces the Distributed Topology strategy for replica clusters. This new strategy allows you to build PostgreSQL clusters across private, public, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments, spanning multiple regions and potentially different cloud providers. It also provides an API to control the switchover operation, ensuring that only one cluster acts as the primary at any given time. This Distributed Topology strategy enhances resilience and scalability, making it a robust solution for modern, distributed applications that require high availability and disaster recovery capabilities across diverse infrastructure setups. You can seamlessly transition from a previous replica cluster configuration to a distributed topology by modifying all the Cluster resources involved in the distributed PostgreSQL setup. Ensure the following steps are taken: Configure the externalClusters section to include all the clusters involved in the distributed topology. We strongly suggest using the same configuration across all Cluster resources for maintainability and consistency. Configure the primary and source fields in the .spec.replica stanza to reflect the distributed topology. The primary field should contain the name of the current primary cluster in the distributed topology, while the source field should contain the name of the cluster each Cluster resource is replicating from. It is important to note that the enabled field, which was previously set to true or false , should now be unset (default).

The second step is automatically triggered after updating the controller. By default, this initiates a rolling update of every deployed PostgreSQL cluster, upgrading one instance at a time to use the new instance manager. The rolling update concludes with a switchover, which is governed by the primaryUpdateStrategy option. The default value, unsupervised , completes the switchover automatically. If set to supervised , the user must manually promote the new primary instance using the cnpg plugin for kubectl . Rolling updates This process is discussed in-depth on the Rolling Updates page. Important In case primaryUpdateStrategy is set to the default value of unsupervised , an upgrade of the operator will trigger a switchover on your PostgreSQL cluster, causing a (normally negligible) downtime. If your PostgreSQL Cluster has only one instance, the instance will be automatically restarted as supervised value is not supported for primaryUpdateStrategy . In either case, your applications will have to reconnect to PostgreSQL. The default rolling update behavior can be replaced with in-place updates of the instance manager.

It simply relies on the Kubernetes API server and a native key component called: the Postgres instance manager . The instance manager takes care of the entire lifecycle of the PostgreSQL server process (also known as postmaster ). When you create a new cluster, the operator makes a Pod per instance. The field .spec.instances specifies how many instances to create. Each Pod will start the instance manager as the parent process (PID 1) for the main container, which in turn runs the PostgreSQL instance. During the lifetime of the Pod, the instance manager acts as a backend to handle the startup, liveness and readiness probes . Startup Probe The startup probe ensures that a PostgreSQL instance, whether a primary or standby, has fully started. Info By default, the startup probe uses pg_isready . However, the behavior can be customized by specifying a different startup strategy. While the startup probe is running, the liveness and readiness probes remain disabled. Following Kubernetes standards, if the startup probe fails, the kubelet will terminate the container, which will then be restarted. The .spec.startDelay parameter specifies the maximum time, in seconds, allowed for the startup probe to succeed. By default, the startDelay is set to 3600 seconds. It is recommended to adjust this setting based on the time PostgreSQL needs to fully initialize in your specific environment. Warning Setting .spec.startDelay too low can cause the liveness probe to activate prematurely, potentially resulting in unnecessary Pod restarts if PostgreSQL hasn\u2019t fully initialized. CloudNativePG configures the startup probe with the following default parameters: failureThreshold: FAILURE_THRESHOLD periodSeconds: 10 successThreshold: 1 timeoutSeconds: 5 The failureThreshold value is automatically calculated by dividing startDelay by periodSeconds . You can customize any of the probe settings in the .spec.probes.startup section of your configuration. Warning Be sure that any custom probe settings are tailored to your cluster's operational requirements to avoid unintended disruptions. Info For more details on probe configuration, refer to the probe API documentation . If you manually specify .spec.probes.startup.failureThreshold , it will override the default behavior and disable the automatic use of startDelay . For example, the following configuration explicitly sets custom probe parameters, bypassing startDelay : # ... snip spec: probes: startup: periodSeconds: 3 timeoutSeconds: 3 failureThreshold: 10 Startup Probe Strategy In certain scenarios, you may need to customize the startup strategy for your PostgreSQL cluster. For example, you might delay marking a replica as started until it begins streaming from the primary or define a replication lag threshold that must be met before considering the replica ready. To accommodate these requirements, CloudNativePG extends the .spec.probes.startup stanza with two optional parameters: type : specifies the criteria for considering the probe successful. Accepted values, in increasing order of complexity/depth, include: pg_isready : marks the probe as successful when the pg_isready command exits with 0 . This is the default for primary instances and replicas. query : marks the probe as successful when a basic query is executed on the postgres database locally. streaming : marks the probe as successful when the replica begins streaming from its source and meets the specified lag requirements (details below). maximumLag : defines the maximum acceptable replication lag, measured in bytes (expressed as Kubernetes quantities). This parameter is only applicable when type is set to streaming . If maximumLag is not specified, the replica is considered successfully started as soon as it begins streaming. Important The .spec.probes.startup.maximumLag option is validated and enforced only during the startup phase of the pod, meaning it applies exclusively when the replica is starting. Warning Incorrect configuration of the maximumLag option can cause continuous failures of the startup probe, leading to repeated replica restarts. Ensure you understand how this option works and configure appropriate values for failureThreshold and periodSeconds to give the replica enough time to catch up with its source. The following example requires a replica to have a maximum lag of 16Mi from the source to be considered started: # <snip> probes: startup: type: streaming maximumLag: 16Mi Liveness Probe The liveness probe begins after the startup probe successfully completes. Its primary role is to ensure the PostgreSQL instance manager is operating correctly. Following Kubernetes standards, if the liveness probe fails, the kubelet will terminate the container, which will then be restarted. The amount of time before a Pod is classified as not alive is configurable via the .spec.livenessProbeTimeout parameter. CloudNativePG configures the liveness probe with the following default parameters: failureThreshold: FAILURE_THRESHOLD periodSeconds: 10 successThreshold: 1 timeoutSeconds: 5 The failureThreshold value is automatically calculated by dividing livenessProbeTimeout by periodSeconds . By default, .spec.livenessProbeTimeout is set to 30 seconds. This means the liveness probe will report a failure if it detects three consecutive probe failures, with a 10-second interval between each check. You can customize any of the probe settings in the .spec.probes.liveness section of your configuration. Warning Be sure that any custom probe settings are tailored to your cluster's operational requirements to avoid unintended disruptions. Info For more details on probe configuration, refer to the probe API documentation . If you manually specify .spec.probes.liveness.failureThreshold , it will override the default behavior and disable the automatic use of livenessProbeTimeout . For example, the following configuration explicitly sets custom probe parameters, bypassing livenessProbeTimeout : # ... snip spec: probes: liveness: periodSeconds: 3 timeoutSeconds: 3 failureThreshold: 10 Readiness Probe The readiness probe starts once the startup probe has successfully completed. Its primary purpose is to check whether the PostgreSQL instance is ready to accept traffic and serve requests at any point during the pod's lifecycle. Info By default, the readiness probe uses pg_isready . However, the behavior can be customized by specifying a different readiness strategy. Following Kubernetes standards, if the readiness probe fails, the pod will be marked unready and will not receive traffic from any services. An unready pod is also ineligible for promotion during automated failover scenarios. CloudNativePG uses the following default configuration for the readiness probe: failureThreshold: 3 periodSeconds: 10 successThreshold: 1 timeoutSeconds: 5 If the default settings do not suit your requirements, you can fully customize the readiness probe by specifying parameters in the .spec.probes.readiness stanza. For example: # ... snip spec: probes: readiness: periodSeconds: 3 timeoutSeconds: 3 failureThreshold: 10 Warning Ensure that any custom probe settings are aligned with your cluster\u2019s operational requirements to prevent unintended disruptions. Info For more information on configuring probes, see the probe API . Readiness Probe Strategy In certain scenarios, you may need to customize the readiness strategy for your cluster. For example, you might delay marking a replica as ready until it begins streaming from the primary or define a maximum replication lag threshold before considering the replica ready. To accommodate these requirements, CloudNativePG extends the .spec.probes.readiness stanza with two optional parameters: type and maximumLag . Please refer to the Startup Probe Strategy section for detailed information on these options. Important Unlike the startup probe, the .spec.probes.readiness.maximumLag option is continuously monitored. A lagging replica may become unready if this setting is not appropriately tuned. Warning Incorrect configuration of the maximumLag option can lead to repeated readiness probe failures, causing serious consequences, such as: Exclusion of the replica from key operator features, such as promotion during failover or participation in synchronous replication quorum. Disruptions in read/read-only services. In longer failover times scenarios, replicas might be declared unready, leading to a cluster stall requiring manual intervention. Recommendation Use the streaming and maximumLag options with extreme caution. If you're unfamiliar with PostgreSQL replication, rely on the default strategy. Seek professional advice if unsure. The following example requires a replica to have a maximum lag of 64Mi from the source to be considered ready. It also provides approximately 300 seconds (30 failures \u00d7 10 seconds) for the startup probe to succeed: # <snip> probes: readiness: type: streaming maximumLag: 64Mi failureThreshold: 30 periodSeconds: 10 Shutdown control When a Pod running Postgres is deleted, either manually or by Kubernetes following a node drain operation, the kubelet will send a termination signal to the instance manager, and the instance manager will take care of shutting down PostgreSQL in an appropriate way. The .spec.smartShutdownTimeout and .spec.stopDelay options, expressed in seconds, control the amount of time given to PostgreSQL to shut down. The values default to 180 and 1800 seconds, respectively. The shutdown procedure is composed of two steps: The instance manager requests a smart shut down, disallowing any new connection to PostgreSQL. This step will last for up to .spec.smartShutdownTimeout seconds. If PostgreSQL is still up, the instance manager requests a fast shut down, terminating any existing connection and exiting promptly. If the instance is archiving and/or streaming WAL files, the process will wait for up to the remaining time set in .spec.stopDelay to complete the operation and then forcibly shut down. Such a timeout needs to be at least 15 seconds. Important In order to avoid any data loss in the Postgres cluster, which impacts the database RPO , don't delete the Pod where the primary instance is running. In this case, perform a switchover to another instance first. Shutdown of the primary during a switchover During a switchover, the shutdown procedure is slightly different from the general case. Indeed, the operator requires the former primary to issue a fast shut down before the selected new primary can be promoted, in order to ensure that all the data are available on the new primary. For this reason, the .spec.switchoverDelay , expressed in seconds, controls the time given to the former primary to shut down gracefully and archive all the WAL files. By default it is set to 3600 (1 hour). Warning The .spec.switchoverDelay option affects the RPO and RTO of your PostgreSQL database. Setting it to a low value, might favor RTO over RPO but lead to data loss at cluster level and/or backup level. On the contrary, setting it to a high value, might remove the risk of data loss while leaving the cluster without an active primary for a longer time during the switchover. Failover In case of primary pod failure, the cluster will go into failover mode. Please refer to the \"Failover\" section for details. Disk Full Failure Storage exhaustion is a well known issue for PostgreSQL clusters. The PostgreSQL documentation highlights the possible failure scenarios and the importance of monitoring disk usage to prevent it from becoming full. The same applies to CloudNativePG and Kubernetes as well: the \"Monitoring\" section provides details on checking the disk space used by WAL segments and standard metrics on disk usage exported to Prometheus. Important In a production system, it is critical to monitor the database continuously. Exhausted disk storage can lead to a database server shutdown. Note The detection of exhausted storage relies on a storage class that accurately reports disk size and usage. This may not be the case in simulated Kubernetes environments like Kind or with test storage class implementations such as csi-driver-host-path . If the disk containing the WALs becomes full and no more WAL segments can be stored, PostgreSQL will stop working. CloudNativePG correctly detects this issue by verifying that there is enough space to store the next WAL segment, and avoids triggering a failover, which could complicate recovery. That allows a human administrator to address the root cause. In such a case, if supported by the storage class, the quickest course of action is currently to: Expand the storage size of the full PVC Increase the size in the Cluster resource to the same value Once the issue is resolved and there is sufficient free space for WAL segments, the Pod will restart and the cluster will become healthy.

For example, you might delay marking a replica as ready until it begins streaming from the primary or define a maximum replication lag threshold before considering the replica ready. To accommodate these requirements, CloudNativePG extends the .spec.probes.readiness stanza with two optional parameters: type and maximumLag . Please refer to the Startup Probe Strategy section for detailed information on these options. Important Unlike the startup probe, the .spec.probes.readiness.maximumLag option is continuously monitored. A lagging replica may become unready if this setting is not appropriately tuned. Warning Incorrect configuration of the maximumLag option can lead to repeated readiness probe failures, causing serious consequences, such as: Exclusion of the replica from key operator features, such as promotion during failover or participation in synchronous replication quorum. Disruptions in read/read-only services. In longer failover times scenarios, replicas might be declared unready, leading to a cluster stall requiring manual intervention. Recommendation Use the streaming and maximumLag options with extreme caution. If you're unfamiliar with PostgreSQL replication, rely on the default strategy. Seek professional advice if unsure. The following example requires a replica to have a maximum lag of 64Mi from the source to be considered ready. It also provides approximately 300 seconds (30 failures \u00d7 10 seconds) for the startup probe to succeed: # <snip> probes: readiness: type: streaming maximumLag: 64Mi failureThreshold: 30 periodSeconds: 10","title":"Readiness Probe Strategy"},{"location":"instance_manager/#shutdown-control","text":"When a Pod running Postgres is deleted, either manually or by Kubernetes following a node drain operation, the kubelet will send a termination signal to the instance manager, and the instance manager will take care of shutting down PostgreSQL in an appropriate way. The .spec.smartShutdownTimeout and .spec.stopDelay options, expressed in seconds, control the amount of time given to PostgreSQL to shut down. The values default to 180 and 1800 seconds, respectively. The shutdown procedure is composed of two steps: The instance manager requests a smart shut down, disallowing any new connection to PostgreSQL. This step will last for up to .spec.smartShutdownTimeout seconds. If PostgreSQL is still up, the instance manager requests a fast shut down, terminating any existing connection and exiting promptly. If the instance is archiving and/or streaming WAL files, the process will wait for up to the remaining time set in .spec.stopDelay to complete the operation and then forcibly shut down. Such a timeout needs to be at least 15 seconds. Important In order to avoid any data loss in the Postgres cluster, which impacts the database RPO , don't delete the Pod where the primary instance is running. In this case, perform a switchover to another instance first.","title":"Shutdown control"},{"location":"instance_manager/#shutdown-of-the-primary-during-a-switchover","text":"During a switchover, the shutdown procedure is slightly different from the general case. Indeed, the operator requires the former primary to issue a fast shut down before the selected new primary can be promoted, in order to ensure that all the data are available on the new primary. For this reason, the .spec.switchoverDelay , expressed in seconds, controls the time given to the former primary to shut down gracefully and archive all the WAL files. By default it is set to 3600 (1 hour). Warning The .spec.switchoverDelay option affects the RPO and RTO of your PostgreSQL database. Setting it to a low value, might favor RTO over RPO but lead to data loss at cluster level and/or backup level. On the contrary, setting it to a high value, might remove the risk of data loss while leaving the cluster without an active primary for a longer time during the switchover.","title":"Shutdown of the primary during a switchover"},{"location":"instance_manager/#failover","text":"In case of primary pod failure, the cluster will go into failover mode. Please refer to the \"Failover\" section for details.","title":"Failover"},{"location":"instance_manager/#disk-full-failure","text":"Storage exhaustion is a well known issue for PostgreSQL clusters. The PostgreSQL documentation highlights the possible failure scenarios and the importance of monitoring disk usage to prevent it from becoming full. The same applies to CloudNativePG and Kubernetes as well: the \"Monitoring\" section provides details on checking the disk space used by WAL segments and standard metrics on disk usage exported to Prometheus. Important In a production system, it is critical to monitor the database continuously. Exhausted disk storage can lead to a database server shutdown. Note The detection of exhausted storage relies on a storage class that accurately reports disk size and usage. This may not be the case in simulated Kubernetes environments like Kind or with test storage class implementations such as csi-driver-host-path . If the disk containing the WALs becomes full and no more WAL segments can be stored, PostgreSQL will stop working. CloudNativePG correctly detects this issue by verifying that there is enough space to store the next WAL segment, and avoids triggering a failover, which could complicate recovery. That allows a human administrator to address the root cause. In such a case, if supported by the storage class, the quickest course of action is currently to: Expand the storage size of the full PVC Increase the size in the Cluster resource to the same value Once the issue is resolved and there is sufficient free space for WAL segments, the Pod will restart and the cluster will become healthy.

Install You can install the cnpg plugin using a variety of methods. Note For air-gapped systems, installation via package managers, using previously downloaded files, may be a good option. Via the installation script curl -sSfL \\ https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/raw/main/hack/install-cnpg-plugin.sh | \\ sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin Using the Debian or RedHat packages In the releases section of the GitHub repository , you can navigate to any release of interest (pick the same or newer release than your CloudNativePG operator), and in it you will find an Assets section. In that section are pre-built packages for a variety of systems. As a result, you can follow standard practices and instructions to install them in your systems. Debian packages For example, let's install the 1.25.1 release of the plugin, for an Intel based 64 bit server. First, we download the right .deb file. wget https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/releases/download/v1.25.1/kubectl-cnpg_1.25.1_linux_x86_64.deb \\ --output-document kube-plugin.deb Then, with superuser privileges, install from the local file using dpkg : $ sudo dpkg -i kube-plugin.deb Selecting previously unselected package cnpg.

If you already have Homebrew installed, you can simply run: brew install kubectl-cnpg When a new version of the plugin is released, you can update the existing installation with: brew update brew upgrade kubectl-cnpg Note Auto-completion for the kubectl plugin is already managed by Homebrew. There's no need to create the kubectl_complete-cnpg script mentioned below. Supported Architectures CloudNativePG Plugin is currently built for the following operating system and architectures: Linux amd64 arm 5/6/7 arm64 s390x ppc64le macOS amd64 arm64 Windows 386 amd64 arm 5/6/7 arm64 Configuring auto-completion To configure auto-completion for the plugin, a helper shell script needs to be installed into your current PATH. Assuming the latter contains /usr/local/bin , this can be done with the following commands: cat > kubectl_complete-cnpg <<EOF #!/usr/bin/env sh # Call the __complete command passing it all arguments kubectl cnpg __complete \"\\$@\" EOF chmod +x kubectl_complete-cnpg # Important: the following command may require superuser permission sudo mv kubectl_complete-cnpg /usr/local/bin Important The name of the script needs to be exactly the one provided since it's used by the kubectl auto-complete process Use Once the plugin is installed and deployed, you can start using it like this: kubectl cnpg COMMAND [ARGS...] Note The plugin automatically detects if the standard output channel is connected to a terminal. In such cases, it may add ANSI colors to the command output. To disable colors, use the --color=never option with the command. Generation of installation manifests The cnpg plugin can be used to generate the YAML manifest for the installation of the operator. This option would typically be used if you want to override some default configurations such as number of replicas, installation namespace, namespaces to watch, and so on. For details and available options, run: kubectl cnpg install generate --help The main options are: -n : specifies the namespace in which to install the operator (default: cnpg-system ). --control-plane : if set to true, the operator deployment will include a toleration and affinity for node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane . --replicas : sets the number of replicas in the deployment. --watch-namespace : specifies a comma-separated list of namespaces to watch (default: all namespaces). --version : defines the minor version of the operator to be installed, such as 1.23 . If a minor version is specified, the plugin installs the latest patch version of that minor version. If no version is supplied, the plugin installs the latest MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version of the operator. An example of the generate command, which will generate a YAML manifest that will install the operator, is as follows: kubectl cnpg install generate \\ -n king \\ --version 1.23 \\ --replicas 3 \\ --watch-namespace \"albert, bb, freddie\" \\ > operator.yaml The flags in the above command have the following meaning: - -n king install the CNPG operator into the king namespace - --version 1.23 install the latest patch version for minor version 1.23 - --replicas 3 install the operator with 3 replicas - --watch-namespace \"albert, bb, freddie\" have the operator watch for changes in the albert , bb and freddie namespaces only Status The status command provides an overview of the current status of your cluster, including: general information : name of the cluster, PostgreSQL's system ID, number of instances, current timeline and position in the WAL backup : point of recoverability, and WAL archiving status as returned by the pg_stat_archiver view from the primary - or designated primary in the case of a replica cluster streaming replication : information taken directly from the pg_stat_replication view on the primary instance instances : information about each Postgres instance, taken directly by each instance manager; in the case of a standby, the Current LSN field corresponds to the latest write-ahead log location that has been replayed during recovery (replay LSN). Important The status information above is taken at different times and at different locations, resulting in slightly inconsistent returned values. For example, the Current Write LSN location in the main header, might be different from the Current LSN field in the instances status as it is taken at two different time intervals. kubectl cnpg status sandbox Cluster Summary Name: default/sandbox System ID: 7423474350493388827 PostgreSQL Image: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:16.4 Primary instance: sandbox-1 Primary start time: 2024-10-08 18:31:57 +0000 UTC (uptime 1m14s) Status: Cluster in healthy state Instances: 3 Ready instances: 3 Size: 126M Current Write LSN: 0/604DE38 (Timeline: 1 - WAL File: 000000010000000000000006) Continuous Backup status Not configured Streaming Replication status Replication Slots Enabled Name Sent LSN Write LSN Flush LSN Replay LSN Write Lag Flush Lag Replay Lag State Sync State Sync Priority Replication Slot ---- -------- --------- --------- ---------- --------- --------- ---------- ----- ---------- ------------- ---------------- sandbox-2 0/604DE38 0/604DE38 0/604DE38 0/604DE38 00:00:00 00:00:00 00:00:00 streaming async 0 active sandbox-3 0/604DE38 0/604DE38 0/604DE38 0/604DE38 00:00:00 00:00:00 00:00:00 streaming async 0 active Instances status Name Current LSN Replication role Status QoS Manager Version Node ---- ----------- ---------------- ------ --- --------------- ---- sandbox-1 0/604DE38 Primary OK BestEffort 1.25.1 k8s-eu-worker sandbox-2 0/604DE38 Standby (async) OK BestEffort 1.25.1 k8s-eu-worker2 sandbox-3 0/604DE38 Standby (async) OK BestEffort 1.25.1 k8s-eu-worker If you require more detailed status information, use the --verbose option (or -v for short).

The command also supports output in yaml and json format. Promote The meaning of this command is to promote a pod in the cluster to primary, so you can start with maintenance work or test a switch-over situation in your cluster: kubectl cnpg promote CLUSTER CLUSTER-INSTANCE Or you can use the instance node number to promote: kubectl cnpg promote CLUSTER INSTANCE Certificates Clusters created using the CloudNativePG operator work with a CA to sign a TLS authentication certificate. To get a certificate, you need to provide a name for the secret to store the credentials, the cluster name, and a user for this certificate: kubectl cnpg certificate cluster-cert --cnpg-cluster CLUSTER --cnpg-user USER After the secret it's created, you can get it using kubectl : kubectl get secret cluster-cert And the content of the same in plain text using the following commands: kubectl get secret cluster-cert -o json | jq -r '.data | map(@base64d) | .[]' Restart The kubectl cnpg restart command can be used in two cases: requesting the operator to orchestrate a rollout restart for a certain cluster. This is useful to apply configuration changes to cluster dependent objects, such as ConfigMaps containing custom monitoring queries. request a single instance restart, either in-place if the instance is the cluster's primary or deleting and recreating the pod if it is a replica. # this command will restart a whole cluster in a rollout fashion kubectl cnpg restart CLUSTER # this command will restart a single instance, according to the policy above kubectl cnpg restart CLUSTER INSTANCE If the in-place restart is requested but the change cannot be applied without a switchover, the switchover will take precedence over the in-place restart. A common case for this will be a minor upgrade of PostgreSQL image. Note If you want ConfigMaps and Secrets to be automatically reloaded by instances, you can add a label with key cnpg.io/reload to it. Reload The kubectl cnpg reload command requests the operator to trigger a reconciliation loop for a certain cluster. This is useful to apply configuration changes to cluster dependent objects, such as ConfigMaps containing custom monitoring queries. The following command will reload all configurations for a given cluster: kubectl cnpg reload CLUSTER Maintenance The kubectl cnpg maintenance command helps to modify one or more clusters across namespaces and set the maintenance window values, it will change the following fields: .spec.nodeMaintenanceWindow.inProgress .spec.nodeMaintenanceWindow.reusePVC Accepts as argument set and unset using this to set the inProgress to true in case set and to false in case of unset . By default, reusePVC is always set to false unless the --reusePVC flag is passed. The plugin will ask for a confirmation with a list of the cluster to modify and their new values, if this is accepted this action will be applied to all the cluster in the list. If you want to set in maintenance all the PostgreSQL in your Kubernetes cluster, just need to write the following command: kubectl cnpg maintenance set --all-namespaces And you'll have the list of all the cluster to update The following are the new values for the clusters Namespace Cluster Name Maintenance reusePVC --------- ------------ ----------- -------- default cluster-example true false default pg-backup true false test cluster-example true false Do you want to proceed? [y/n]: y Report The kubectl cnpg report command bundles various pieces of information into a ZIP file. It aims to provide the needed context to debug problems with clusters in production. It has two sub-commands: operator and cluster . report Operator The operator sub-command requests the operator to provide information regarding the operator deployment, configuration and events. Important All confidential information in Secrets and ConfigMaps is REDACTED. The Data map will show the keys but the values will be empty. The flag -S / --stopRedaction will defeat the redaction and show the values. Use only at your own risk, this will share private data. Note By default, operator logs are not collected, but you can enable operator log collection with the --logs flag deployment information : the operator Deployment and operator Pod configuration : the Secrets and ConfigMaps in the operator namespace events : the Events in the operator namespace webhook configuration : the mutating and validating webhook configurations webhook service : the webhook service logs : logs for the operator Pod (optional, off by default) in JSON-lines format The command will generate a ZIP file containing various manifest in YAML format (by default, but settable to JSON with the -o flag). Use the -f flag to name a result file explicitly. If the -f flag is not used, a default time-stamped filename is created for the zip file. Note The report plugin obeys kubectl conventions, and will look for objects constrained by namespace. The CNPG Operator will generally not be installed in the same namespace as the clusters. E.g. the default installation namespace is cnpg-system kubectl cnpg report operator -n cnpg-system results in Successfully written report to \"report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>.zip\" (format: \"yaml\") With the -f flag set: kubectl cnpg report operator -n cnpg-system -f reportRedacted.zip Unzipping the file will produce a time-stamped top-level folder to keep the directory tidy: unzip reportRedacted.zip will result in: Archive: reportRedacted.zip creating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/ creating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/ inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/deployment.yaml inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/operator-pod.yaml inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/events.yaml inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/validating-webhook-configuration.yaml inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/mutating-webhook-configuration.yaml inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/webhook-service.yaml inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cnpg-ca-secret(secret).yaml inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cnpg-webhook-cert(secret).yaml If you activated the --logs option, you'd see an extra subdirectory: Archive: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>.zip <snipped \u2026> creating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/operator-logs/ inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/operator-logs/cnpg-controller-manager-66fb98dbc5-pxkmh-logs.jsonl Note The plugin will try to get the PREVIOUS operator's logs, which is helpful when investigating restarted operators. In all cases, it will also try to get the CURRENT operator logs. If current and previous logs are available, it will show them both. ====== Beginning of Previous Log ===== 2023-03-28T12:56:41.251711811Z {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2023-03-28T12:56:41Z\",\"logger\":\"setup\",\"msg\":\"Starting CloudNativePG Operator\",\"version\":\"1.25.1\",\"build\":{\"Version\":\"1.25.1+dev107\",\"Commit\":\"cc9bab17\",\"Date\":\"2023-03-28\"}} 2023-03-28T12:56:41.251851909Z {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2023-03-28T12:56:41Z\",\"logger\":\"setup\",\"msg\":\"Starting pprof HTTP server\",\"addr\":\"0.0.0.0:6060\"} <snipped \u2026> ====== End of Previous Log ===== 2023-03-28T12:57:09.854306024Z {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2023-03-28T12:57:09Z\",\"logger\":\"setup\",\"msg\":\"Starting CloudNativePG Operator\",\"version\":\"1.25.1\",\"build\":{\"Version\":\"1.25.1+dev107\",\"Commit\":\"cc9bab17\",\"Date\":\"2023-03-28\"}} 2023-03-28T12:57:09.854363943Z {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2023-03-28T12:57:09Z\",\"logger\":\"setup\",\"msg\":\"Starting pprof HTTP server\",\"addr\":\"0.0.0.0:6060\"} If the operator hasn't been restarted, you'll still see the ====== Begin \u2026 and ====== End \u2026 guards, with no content inside.

Note By default, cluster logs are not collected, but you can enable cluster log collection with the --logs flag Usage: kubectl cnpg report cluster CLUSTER [flags] Note that, unlike the operator sub-command, for the cluster sub-command you need to provide the cluster name, and very likely the namespace, unless the cluster is in the default one. kubectl cnpg report cluster CLUSTER -f report.zip [-n NAMESPACE] and then: unzip report.zip Archive: report.zip creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/ creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/ inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster.yaml inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster-pods.yaml inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster-jobs.yaml inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/events.yaml Remember that you can use the --logs flag to add the pod and job logs to the ZIP. kubectl cnpg report cluster CLUSTER [-n NAMESPACE] --logs will result in: Successfully written report to \"report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>.zip\" (format: \"yaml\") unzip report_cluster_<TIMESTAMP>.zip Archive: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>.zip creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/ creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/ inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster.yaml inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster-pods.yaml inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster-jobs.yaml inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/events.yaml creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/logs/ inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/logs/cluster-example-full-1.jsonl creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/job-logs/ inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/job-logs/cluster-example-full-1-initdb-qnnvw.jsonl inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/job-logs/cluster-example-full-2-join-tvj8r.jsonl Logs The kubectl cnpg logs command allows to follow the logs of a collection of pods related to CloudNativePG in a single go. It has at the moment one available sub-command: cluster . Cluster logs The cluster sub-command gathers all the pod logs for a cluster in a single stream or file. This means that you can get all the pod logs in a single terminal window, with a single invocation of the command. As in all the cnpg plugin sub-commands, you can get instructions and help with the -h flag: kubectl cnpg logs cluster -h The logs command will display logs in JSON-lines format, unless the --timestamps flag is used, in which case, a human-readable timestamp will be prepended to each line. In this case, lines will no longer be valid JSON, and tools such as jq may not work as desired. If the logs cluster sub-command is given the -f flag (aka --follow ), it will follow the cluster pod logs, and will also watch for any new pods created in the cluster after the command has been invoked. Any new pods found, including pods that have been restarted or re-created, will also have their pods followed. The logs will be displayed in the terminal's standard-out. This command will only exit when the cluster has no more pods left, or when it is interrupted by the user. If logs is called without the -f option, it will read the logs from all cluster pods until the time of invocation and display them in the terminal's standard-out, then exit. The -o or --output flag can be provided, to specify the name of the file where the logs should be saved, instead of displaying over standard-out. The --tail flag can be used to specify how many log lines will be retrieved from each pod in the cluster. By default, the logs cluster sub-command will display all the logs from each pod in the cluster. If combined with the \"follow\" flag -f , the number of logs specified by --tail will be retrieved until the current time, and from then the new logs will be followed. NOTE: unlike other cnpg plugin commands, the -f is used to denote \"follow\" rather than specify a file. This keeps with the convention of kubectl logs , which takes -f to mean the logs should be followed. Usage: kubectl cnpg logs cluster CLUSTER [flags] Using the -f option to follow: kubectl cnpg report cluster CLUSTER -f Using --tail option to display 3 lines from each pod and the -f option to follow: kubectl cnpg report cluster CLUSTER -f --tail 3 {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2023-06-30T13:37:33Z\",\"logger\":\"postgres\",\"msg\":\"2023-06-30 13:37:33.142 UTC [26] LOG: ending log output to stderr\",\"source\":\"/controller/log/postgres\",\"logging_pod\":\"cluster-example-3\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2023-06-30T13:37:33Z\",\"logger\":\"postgres\",\"msg\":\"2023-06-30 13:37:33.142 UTC [26] HINT: Future log output will go to log destination \\\"csvlog\\\".\",\"source\":\"/controller/log/postgres\",\"logging_pod\":\"cluster-example-3\"} \u2026 \u2026 With the -o option omitted, and with --output specified: $ kubectl cnpg logs cluster CLUSTER --output my-cluster.log Successfully written logs to \"my-cluster.log\" Pretty The pretty sub-command reads a log stream from standard input, formats it into a human-readable output, and attempts to sort the entries by timestamp. It can be used in combination with kubectl cnpg logs cluster , as shown in the following example: $ kubectl cnpg logs cluster cluster-example | kubectl cnpg logs pretty 2024-10-15T17:35:00.336 INFO cluster-example-1 instance-manager Starting CloudNativePG Instance Manager 2024-10-15T17:35:00.336 INFO cluster-example-1 instance-manager Checking for free disk space for WALs before starting PostgreSQL 2024-10-15T17:35:00.347 INFO cluster-example-1 instance-manager starting tablespace manager 2024-10-15T17:35:00.347 INFO cluster-example-1 instance-manager starting external server manager [...] Alternatively, it can be used in combination with other commands that produce CNPG logs in JSON format, such as stern , or kubectl logs , as in the following example: $ kubectl logs cluster-example-1 | kubectl cnpg logs pretty 2024-10-15T17:35:00.336 INFO cluster-example-1 instance-manager Starting CloudNativePG Instance Manager 2024-10-15T17:35:00.336 INFO cluster-example-1 instance-manager Checking for free disk space for WALs before starting PostgreSQL 2024-10-15T17:35:00.347 INFO cluster-example-1 instance-manager starting tablespace manager 2024-10-15T17:35:00.347 INFO cluster-example-1 instance-manager starting external server manager [...] The pretty sub-command also supports advanced log filtering, allowing users to display logs for specific pods or loggers, or to filter logs by severity level. Here's an example: $ kubectl cnpg logs cluster cluster-example | kubectl cnpg logs pretty --pods cluster-example-1 --loggers postgres --log-level info 2024-10-15T17:35:00.509 INFO cluster-example-1 postgres 2024-10-15 17:35:00.509 UTC [29] LOG: redirecting log output to logging collector process 2024-10-15T17:35:00.509 INFO cluster-example-1 postgres 2024-10-15 17:35:00.509 UTC [29] HINT: Future log output will appear in directory \"/controller/log\"... 2024-10-15T17:35:00.510 INFO cluster-example-1 postgres 2024-10-15 17:35:00.509 UTC [29] LOG: ending log output to stderr 2024-10-15T17:35:00.510 INFO cluster-example-1 postgres ending log output to stderr [...] The pretty sub-command will try to sort the log stream, to make logs easier to reason about. In order to achieve this, it gathers the logs into groups, and within groups it sorts by timestamp. This is the only way to sort interactively, as pretty may be piped from a command in \"follow\" mode. The sub-command will add a group separator line, --- , at the end of each sorted group. The size of the grouping can be configured via the --sorting-group-size flag (default: 1000), as illustrated in the following example: $ kubectl cnpg logs cluster cluster-example | kubectl cnpg logs pretty --sorting-group-size=3 2024-10-15T17:35:20.426 INFO cluster-example-2 instance-manager Starting CloudNativePG Instance Manager 2024-10-15T17:35:20.426 INFO cluster-example-2 instance-manager Checking for free disk space for WALs before starting PostgreSQL 2024-10-15T17:35:20.438 INFO cluster-example-2 instance-manager starting tablespace manager --- 2024-10-15T17:35:20.438 INFO cluster-example-2 instance-manager starting external server manager 2024-10-15T17:35:20.438 INFO cluster-example-2 instance-manager starting controller-runtime manager 2024-10-15T17:35:20.439 INFO cluster-example-2 instance-manager Starting EventSource --- [...] To explore all available options, use the -h flag for detailed explanations of the supported flags and their usage. Info You can also increase the verbosity of the log by adding more -v options. Destroy The kubectl cnpg destroy command helps remove an instance and all the associated PVCs from a Kubernetes cluster. The optional --keep-pvc flag, if specified, allows you to keep the PVCs, while removing all metadata.ownerReferences that were set by the instance. Additionally, the cnpg.io/pvcStatus label on the PVCs will change from ready to detached to signify that they are no longer in use. Running again the command without the --keep-pvc flag will remove the detached PVCs. Usage: kubectl cnpg destroy CLUSTER INSTANCE The following example removes the cluster-example-2 pod and the associated PVCs: kubectl cnpg destroy cluster-example 2 Cluster Hibernation There are times when you may need to temporarily suspend a CloudNativePG Cluster while preserving its data, allowing you to resume operations later. This feature is known as cluster hibernation . Hibernation is managed declaratively using the cnpg.io/hibernation annotation. Info For more details, see the \"Declarative Hibernation\" documentation page. To simplify the process, the cnpg plugin for kubectl provides a hibernate command, which acts as a convenient shortcut for applying the annotation. To hibernate a cluster, run: kubectl cnpg hibernate on CLUSTER This command applies the cnpg.io/hibernation=on annotation to the cluster, suspending its execution. To resume a hibernated cluster, use: kubectl cnpg hibernate off CLUSTER This will remove the hibernation state by setting cnpg.io/hibernation=off . You can check the cluster\u2019s status at any time with: kubectl cnpg status CLUSTER This will display the current state of the cluster, including whether it is hibernated. Benchmarking the database with pgbench Pgbench can be run against an existing PostgreSQL cluster with following command: kubectl cnpg pgbench CLUSTER -- --time 30 --client 1 --jobs 1 Refer to the Benchmarking pgbench section for more details. Benchmarking the storage with fio fio can be run on an existing storage class with following command: kubectl cnpg fio FIO_JOB_NAME [-n NAMESPACE] Refer to the Benchmarking fio section for more details. Requesting a new physical backup The kubectl cnpg backup command requests a new physical backup for an existing Postgres cluster by creating a new Backup resource. The following example requests an on-demand backup for a given cluster: kubectl cnpg backup CLUSTER or, if using volume snapshots: kubectl cnpg backup CLUSTER -m volumeSnapshot The created backup will be named after the request time: $ kubectl cnpg backup cluster-example backup/cluster-example-20230121002300 created By default, a newly created backup will use the backup target policy defined in the cluster to choose which instance to run on. However, you can override this policy with the --backup-target option. In the case of volume snapshot backups, you can also use the --online option to request an online/hot backup or an offline/cold one: additionally, you can also tune online backups by explicitly setting the --immediate-checkpoint and --wait-for-archive options. The \"Backup\" section contains more information about the configuration settings. Launching psql The kubectl cnpg psql CLUSTER command starts a new PostgreSQL interactive front-end process (psql) connected to an existing Postgres cluster, as if you were running it from the actual pod. This means that you will be using the postgres user. Important As you will be connecting as postgres user, in production environments this method should be used with extreme care, by authorized personnel only. $ kubectl cnpg psql cluster-example psql (17.4 (Debian 17.4-1.pgdg110+1)) Type \"help\" for help. postgres=# By default, the command will connect to the primary instance. The user can select to work against a replica by using the --replica option: $ kubectl cnpg psql --replica cluster-example psql (17.4 (Debian 17.4-1.pgdg110+1)) Type \"help\" for help. postgres=# select pg_is_in_recovery(); pg_is_in_recovery ------------------- t (1 row) postgres=# \\q This command will start kubectl exec , and the kubectl executable must be reachable in your PATH variable to correctly work. Snapshotting a Postgres cluster Warning The kubectl cnpg snapshot command has been removed. Please use the backup command to request backups using volume snapshots. Using pgAdmin4 for evaluation/demonstration purposes only pgAdmin stands as the most popular and feature-rich open-source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL. For more information on the project, please refer to the official documentation . Given that the pgAdmin Development Team maintains official Docker container images, you can install pgAdmin in your environment as a standard Kubernetes deployment. Important Deployment of pgAdmin in Kubernetes production environments is beyond the scope of this document and, more broadly, of the CloudNativePG project. However, for the purposes of demonstration and evaluation , CloudNativePG offers a suitable solution. The cnpg plugin implements the pgadmin4 command, providing a straightforward method to connect to a given database Cluster and navigate its content in a local environment such as kind . For example, you can install a demo deployment of pgAdmin4 for the cluster-example cluster as follows: kubectl cnpg pgadmin4 cluster-example This command will produce: ConfigMap/cluster-example-pgadmin4 created Deployment/cluster-example-pgadmin4 created Service/cluster-example-pgadmin4 created Secret/cluster-example-pgadmin4 created [...] After deploying pgAdmin, forward the port using kubectl and connect through your browser by following the on-screen instructions. As usual, you can use the --dry-run option to generate the YAML file: kubectl cnpg pgadmin4 --dry-run cluster-example pgAdmin4 can be installed in either desktop or server mode, with the default being server. In server mode, authentication is required using a randomly generated password, and users must manually specify the database to connect to. On the other hand, desktop mode initiates a pgAdmin web interface without requiring authentication. It automatically connects to the app database as the app user, making it ideal for quick demos, such as on a local deployment using kind : kubectl cnpg pgadmin4 --mode desktop cluster-example After concluding your demo, ensure the termination of the pgAdmin deployment by executing: kubectl cnpg pgadmin4 --dry-run cluster-example | kubectl delete -f - Warning Never deploy pgAdmin in production using the plugin. Logical Replication Publications The cnpg publication command group is designed to streamline the creation and removal of PostgreSQL logical replication publications . Be aware that these commands are primarily intended for assisting in the creation of logical replication publications, particularly on remote PostgreSQL databases. Warning It is crucial to have a solid understanding of both the capabilities and limitations of PostgreSQL's native logical replication system before using these commands. In particular, be mindful of the logical replication restrictions . Creating a new publication To create a logical replication publication, use the cnpg publication create command. The basic structure of this command is as follows: kubectl cnpg publication create \\ --publication PUBLICATION_NAME \\ [--external-cluster EXTERNAL_CLUSTER] LOCAL_CLUSTER [options] There are two primary use cases: With --external-cluster : Use this option to create a publication on an external cluster (i.e. defined in the externalClusters stanza). The commands will be issued from the LOCAL_CLUSTER , but the publication will be for the data in EXTERNAL_CLUSTER . Without --external-cluster : Use this option to create a publication in the LOCAL_CLUSTER PostgreSQL Cluster (by default, the app database). Warning When connecting to an external cluster, ensure that the specified user has sufficient permissions to execute the CREATE PUBLICATION command. You have several options, similar to the CREATE PUBLICATION command, to define the group of tables to replicate. Notable options include: If you specify the --all-tables option, you create a publication FOR ALL TABLES . Alternatively, you can specify multiple occurrences of: --table : Add a specific table (with an expression) to the publication. --schema : Include all tables in the specified database schema (available from PostgreSQL 15). The --dry-run option enables you to preview the SQL commands that the plugin will execute. For additional information and detailed instructions, type the following command: kubectl cnpg publication create --help Example Given a source-cluster and a destination-cluster , we would like to create a publication for the data on source-cluster . The destination-cluster has an entry in the externalClusters stanza pointing to source-cluster . We can run: kubectl cnpg publication create destination-cluster \\ --external-cluster=source-cluster --all-tables which will create a publication for all tables on source-cluster , running the SQL commands on the destination-cluster . Or instead, we can run: kubectl cnpg publication create source-cluster \\ --publication=app --all-tables which will create a publication named app for all the tables in the source-cluster , running the SQL commands on the source cluster. Info There are two sample files that have been provided for illustration and inspiration: logical-source and logical-destination . Dropping a publication The cnpg publication drop command seamlessly complements the create command by offering similar key options, including the publication name, cluster name, and an optional external cluster. You can drop a PUBLICATION with the following command structure: kubectl cnpg publication drop \\ --publication PUBLICATION_NAME \\ [--external-cluster EXTERNAL_CLUSTER] LOCAL_CLUSTER [options] To access further details and precise instructions, use the following command: kubectl cnpg publication drop --help Logical Replication Subscriptions The cnpg subscription command group is a dedicated set of commands designed to simplify the creation and removal of PostgreSQL logical replication subscriptions . These commands are specifically crafted to aid in the establishment of logical replication subscriptions, especially when dealing with remote PostgreSQL databases. Warning Before using these commands, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of both the capabilities and limitations of PostgreSQL's native logical replication system. In particular, be mindful of the logical replication restrictions . In addition to subscription management, we provide a helpful command for synchronizing all sequences from the source cluster. While its applicability may vary, this command can be particularly useful in scenarios involving major upgrades or data import from remote servers. Creating a new subscription To create a logical replication subscription, use the cnpg subscription create command. The basic structure of this command is as follows: kubectl cnpg subscription create \\ --subscription SUBSCRIPTION_NAME \\ --publication PUBLICATION_NAME \\ --external-cluster EXTERNAL_CLUSTER \\ LOCAL_CLUSTER [options] This command configures a subscription directed towards the specified publication in the designated external cluster, as defined in the externalClusters stanza of the LOCAL_CLUSTER . For additional information and detailed instructions, type the following command: kubectl cnpg subscription create --help Example As in the section on publications, we have a source-cluster and a destination-cluster , and we have already created a publication called app . The following command: kubectl cnpg subscription create destination-cluster \\ --external-cluster=source-cluster \\ --publication=app --subscription=app will create a subscription for app on the destination cluster. Warning Prioritize testing subscriptions in a non-production environment to ensure their effectiveness and identify any potential issues before implementing them in a production setting. Info There are two sample files that have been provided for illustration and inspiration: logical-source and logical-destination . Dropping a subscription The cnpg subscription drop command seamlessly complements the create command. You can drop a SUBSCRIPTION with the following command structure: kubectl cnpg subcription drop \\ --subscription SUBSCRIPTION_NAME \\ LOCAL_CLUSTER [options] To access further details and precise instructions, use the following command: kubectl cnpg subscription drop --help Synchronizing sequences One notable constraint of PostgreSQL logical replication, implemented through publications and subscriptions, is the lack of sequence synchronization. This becomes particularly relevant when utilizing logical replication for live database migration, especially to a higher version of PostgreSQL. A crucial step in this process involves updating sequences before transitioning applications to the new database ( cutover ). To address this limitation, the cnpg subscription sync-sequences command offers a solution. This command establishes a connection with the source database, retrieves all relevant sequences, and subsequently updates local sequences with matching identities (based on database schema and sequence name). You can use the command as shown below: kubectl cnpg subscription sync-sequences \\ --subscription SUBSCRIPTION_NAME \\ LOCAL_CLUSTER For comprehensive details and specific instructions, utilize the following command: kubectl cnpg subscription sync-sequences --help Example As in the previous sections for publication and subscription, we have a source-cluster and a destination-cluster . The publication and the subscription, both called app , are already present. The following command will synchronize the sequences involved in the app subscription, from the source cluster into the destination cluster. kubectl cnpg subscription sync-sequences destination-cluster \\ --subscription=app Warning Prioritize testing subscriptions in a non-production environment to guarantee their effectiveness and detect any potential issues before deploying them in a production setting. Integration with K9s The cnpg plugin can be easily integrated in K9s , a popular terminal-based UI to interact with Kubernetes clusters. See k9s/plugins.yml for details. Permissions required by the plugin The plugin requires a set of Kubernetes permissions that depends on the command to execute. These permissions may affect resources and sub-resources like Pods, PDBs, PVCs, and enable actions like get , delete , patch . The following table contains the full details: Command Resource Permissions backup clusters: get backups: create certificate clusters: get secrets: get,create destroy pods: get,delete jobs: delete,list PVCs: list,delete,update fencing clusters: get,patch pods: get fio PVCs: create configmaps: create deployment: create hibernate clusters: get,patch,delete pods: list,get,delete pods/exec: create jobs: list PVCs: get,list,update,patch,delete install none logs clusters: get pods: list pods/log: get maintenance clusters: get,patch,list pgadmin4 clusters: get configmaps: create deployments: create services: create secrets: create pgbench clusters: get jobs: create promote clusters: get clusters/status: patch pods: get psql pods: get,list pods/exec: create publication clusters: get pods: get,list pods/exec: create reload clusters: get,patch report cluster clusters: get pods: list pods/log: get jobs: list events: list PVCs: list report operator configmaps: get deployments: get events: list pods: list pods/log: get secrets: get services: get mutatingwebhookconfigurations: list 1 validatingwebhookconfigurations: list 1 If OLM is present on the K8s cluster, also: clusterserviceversions: list installplans: list subscriptions: list restart clusters: get,patch pods: get,delete status clusters: get pods: list pods/exec: create pods/proxy: create PDBs: list subscription clusters: get pods: get,list pods/exec: create version none The permissions are cluster scope ClusterRole resources. \u21a9 \u21a9 Additionally, assigning the list permission on the clusters will enable autocompletion for multiple commands. Role examples It is possible to create roles with restricted permissions. The following example creates a role that only has access to the cluster logs: --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: cnpg-log rules: - verbs: - get apiGroups: - postgresql.cnpg.io resources: - clusters - verbs: - list apiGroups: - '' resources: - pods - verbs: - get apiGroups: - '' resources: - pods/log The next example shows a role with the minimal permissions required to get the cluster status using the plugin's status command: apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: cnpg-status rules: - verbs: - get apiGroups: - postgresql.cnpg.io resources: - clusters - verbs: - list apiGroups: - '' resources: - pods - verbs: - create apiGroups: - '' resources: - pods/exec - verbs: - create apiGroups: - '' resources: - pods/proxy - verbs: - list apiGroups: - policy resources: - poddisruptionbudgets Important Keeping the verbs restricted per resources and per apiGroups helps to prevent inadvertently granting more than intended permissions.","title":"Kubectl Plugin"},{"location":"kubectl-plugin/#kubectl-plugin","text":"CloudNativePG provides a plugin for kubectl to manage a cluster in Kubernetes.","title":"Kubectl Plugin"},{"location":"kubectl-plugin/#install","text":"You can install the cnpg plugin using a variety of methods.

If the logs cluster sub-command is given the -f flag (aka --follow ), it will follow the cluster pod logs, and will also watch for any new pods created in the cluster after the command has been invoked. Any new pods found, including pods that have been restarted or re-created, will also have their pods followed. The logs will be displayed in the terminal's standard-out. This command will only exit when the cluster has no more pods left, or when it is interrupted by the user. If logs is called without the -f option, it will read the logs from all cluster pods until the time of invocation and display them in the terminal's standard-out, then exit.

Regular updates help address technical debt and mitigate business risks, despite the controlled downtimes associated with temporarily removing a node from the cluster for maintenance purposes. For further insights on embracing risk in operations, refer to the \"Embracing Risk\" chapter from the Site Reliability Engineering book. Importance of Regular Updates Updating Kubernetes involves planning and executing maintenance tasks, such as applying security updates to underlying Linux servers, replacing malfunctioning hardware components, or upgrading the cluster to the latest Kubernetes version. These activities are essential for maintaining a robust and secure infrastructure. Maintenance Operations in a Cluster Typically, maintenance operations are carried out on one node at a time, following a structured process : eviction of workloads ( drain ): workloads are gracefully moved away from the node to be updated, ensuring a smooth transition. performing the operation: the actual maintenance operation, such as a system update or hardware replacement, is executed. rejoining the node to the cluster ( uncordon ): the updated node is reintegrated into the cluster, ready to resume its responsibilities. This process requires either stopping workloads for the entire upgrade duration or migrating them to other nodes in the cluster. Temporary PostgreSQL Cluster Degradation While the standard approach ensures service reliability and leverages Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities, there are scenarios where operating with a temporarily degraded cluster may be acceptable. This is particularly relevant for PostgreSQL clusters relying on node-local storage , where the storage is local to the Kubernetes worker node running the PostgreSQL database. Node-local storage, or simply local storage , is employed to enhance performance. Note If your database files reside on shared storage accessible over the network, the default self-healing behavior of the operator can efficiently handle scenarios where volumes are reused by pods on different nodes after a drain operation. In such cases, you can skip the remaining sections of this document. Pod Disruption Budgets By default, CloudNativePG safeguards Postgres cluster operations. If a node is to be drained and contains a cluster's primary instance, a switchover happens ahead of the drain. Once the instance in the node is downgraded to replica, the draining can resume. For single-instance clusters, a switchover is not possible, so CloudNativePG will prevent draining the node where the instance is housed. Additionally, in clusters with 3 or more instances, CloudNativePG guarantees that only one replica at a time is gracefully shut down during a drain operation. Each PostgreSQL Cluster is equipped with two associated PodDisruptionBudget resources - you can easily confirm it with the kubectl get pdb command. Our recommendation is to leave pod disruption budgets enabled for every production Postgres cluster. This can be effortlessly managed by toggling the .spec.enablePDB option, as detailed in the API reference . PostgreSQL Clusters used for Development or Testing For PostgreSQL clusters used for development purposes, often consisting of a single instance, it is essential to disable pod disruption budgets. Failure to do so will prevent the node hosting that cluster from being drained. The following example illustrates how to disable pod disruption budgets for a 1-instance development cluster: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: dev spec: instances: 1 enablePDB: false storage: size: 1Gi This configuration ensures smoother maintenance procedures without restrictions on draining the node during development activities. Node Maintenance Window Important While CloudNativePG will continue supporting the node maintenance window, it is currently recommended to transition to direct control of pod disruption budgets, as explained in the previous section. This section is retained mainly for backward compatibility. Prior to release 1.23, CloudNativePG had just one declarative mechanism to manage Kubernetes upgrades when dealing with local storage: you had to temporarily put the cluster in maintenance mode through the nodeMaintenanceWindow option to avoid standard self-healing procedures to kick in, while, for example, enlarging the partition on the physical node or updating the node itself. Warning Limit the duration of the maintenance window to the shortest amount of time possible. In this phase, some of the expected behaviors of Kubernetes are either disabled or running with some limitations, including self-healing, rolling updates, and Pod disruption budget. The nodeMaintenanceWindow option of the cluster has two further settings: inProgress : Boolean value that states if the maintenance window for the nodes is currently in progress or not. By default, it is set to off . During the maintenance window, the reusePVC option below is evaluated by the operator. reusePVC : Boolean value that defines if an existing PVC is reused or not during the maintenance operation. By default, it is set to on . When enabled , Kubernetes waits for the node to come up again and then reuses the existing PVC; the PodDisruptionBudget policy is temporarily removed. When disabled , Kubernetes forces the recreation of the Pod on a different node with a new PVC by relying on PostgreSQL's physical streaming replication, then destroys the old PVC together with the Pod. This scenario is generally not recommended unless the database's size is small, and re-cloning the new PostgreSQL instance takes shorter than waiting. This behavior does not apply to clusters with only one instance and reusePVC disabled: see section below. Note When performing the kubectl drain command, you will need to add the --delete-emptydir-data option. Don't be afraid: it refers to another volume internally used by the operator - not the PostgreSQL data directory. Important PodDisruptionBudget management can be disabled by setting the .spec.enablePDB field to false . In that case, the operator won't create PodDisruptionBudgets and will delete them if they were previously created. Single instance clusters with reusePVC set to false Important We recommend to always create clusters with more than one instance in order to guarantee high availability. Deleting the only PostgreSQL instance in a single instance cluster with reusePVC set to false would imply all data being lost, therefore we prevent users from draining nodes such instances might be running on, even in maintenance mode. However, in case maintenance is required for such a node you have two options: Enable reusePVC , accepting the downtime Replicate the instance on a different node and switch over the primary As long as a database service downtime is acceptable for your environment, draining the node is as simple as setting the nodeMaintenanceWindow to inProgress: true and reusePVC: true . This will allow the instance to be deleted and recreated as soon as the original PVC is available (e.g. with node local storage, as soon as the node is back up). Otherwise you will have to scale up the cluster, creating a new instance on a different node and promoting the new instance to primary in order to shut down the original one on the node undergoing maintenance. The only downtime in this case will be the duration of the switchover. A possible approach could be: Cordon the node on which the current instance is running. Scale up the cluster to 2 instances, could take some time depending on the database size. As soon as the new instance is running, the operator will automatically perform a switchover given that the current primary is running on a cordoned node.

However, such resources and objects can be linked together and put in relationship through labels and annotations . Info For more information, see the Kubernetes documentation on annotations and labels . In brief: An annotation is used to assign additional non-identifying information to resources with the goal of facilitating integration with external tools. A label is used to group objects and query them through the Kubernetes native selector capability. You can select one or more labels or annotations to use in your CloudNativePG deployments. Then you need to configure the operator so that when you define these labels or annotations in a cluster's metadata, they're inherited by all resources created by it (including pods). Note Label and annotation inheritance is the technique adopted by CloudNativePG instead of alternative approaches such as pod templates.

Prerequisites By default, no label or annotation defined in the cluster's metadata is inherited by the associated resources. To enable label/annotation inheritance, follow the instructions provided in Operator configuration . The following continues from that example and limits it to the following: Annotations: categories Labels: app , environment , and workload Note Feel free to select the names that most suit your context for both annotations and labels. You can also use wildcards in naming and adopt strategies like using mycompany/* for all labels or setting annotations starting with mycompany/ to be inherited. Defining cluster's metadata When defining the cluster, before any resource is deployed, you can set the metadata as follows: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example annotations: categories: database labels: environment: production workload: database app: sso spec: # ... <snip> Once the cluster is deployed, you can verify, for example, that the labels were correctly set in the pods: kubectl get pods --show-labels Current limitations Currently, CloudNativePG doesn't automatically propagate labels or annotations deletions.

Logical replication replicates data objects and their changes based on a defined replication identity, typically the primary key. Logical replication uses a publish-and-subscribe model, where subscribers connect to publications on a publisher node. Subscribers pull data changes from these publications and can re-publish them, enabling cascading replication and complex topologies. This flexible model is particularly useful for: Online data migrations Live PostgreSQL version upgrades Data distribution across systems Real-time analytics Integration with external applications Info For more details, examples, and limitations, please refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation on Logical Replication . CloudNativePG enhances this capability by providing declarative support for key PostgreSQL logical replication objects: Publications via the Publication resource Subscriptions via the Subscription resource Publications In PostgreSQL's publish-and-subscribe replication model, a publication is the source of data changes. It acts as a logical container for the change sets (also known as replication sets ) generated from one or more tables within a database. Publications can be defined on any PostgreSQL 10+ instance acting as the publisher , including instances managed by popular DBaaS solutions in the public cloud. Each publication is tied to a single database and provides fine-grained control over which tables and changes are replicated. For publishers outside Kubernetes, you can create publications using SQL or leverage the cnpg publication create plugin command . When managing Cluster objects with CloudNativePG , PostgreSQL publications can be defined declaratively through the Publication resource. Info Please refer to the API reference for the full list of attributes you can define for each Publication object. Suppose you have a cluster named freddie and want to replicate all tables in the app database. Here's a Publication manifest: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Publication metadata: name: freddie-publisher spec: cluster: name: freddie dbname: app name: publisher target: allTables: true In the above example: The publication object is named freddie-publisher ( metadata.name ). The publication is created via the primary of the freddie cluster ( spec.cluster.name ) with name publisher ( spec.name ). It includes all tables ( spec.target.allTables: true ) from the app database ( spec.dbname ). Important While allTables simplifies configuration, PostgreSQL offers fine-grained control for replicating specific tables or targeted data changes. For advanced configurations, consult the PostgreSQL documentation . Additionally, refer to the CloudNativePG API reference for details on declaratively customizing replication targets. Required Fields in the Publication Manifest The following fields are required for a Publication object: metadata.name : Unique name for the Kubernetes Publication object. spec.cluster.name : Name of the PostgreSQL cluster. spec.dbname : Database name where the publication is created. spec.name : Publication name in PostgreSQL. spec.target : Specifies the tables or changes to include in the publication. The Publication object must reference a specific Cluster , determining where the publication will be created. It is managed by the cluster's primary instance, ensuring the publication is created or updated as needed. Reconciliation and Status After creating a Publication , CloudNativePG manages it on the primary instance of the specified cluster. Following a successful reconciliation cycle, the Publication status will reflect the following: applied: true , indicates the configuration has been successfully applied. observedGeneration matches metadata.generation , confirming the applied configuration corresponds to the most recent changes. If an error occurs during reconciliation, status.applied will be false , and an error message will be included in the status.message field. Removing a publication The publicationReclaimPolicy field controls the behavior when deleting a Publication object: retain (default): Leaves the publication in PostgreSQL for manual management. delete : Automatically removes the publication from PostgreSQL. Consider the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Publication metadata: name: freddie-publisher spec: cluster: name: freddie dbname: app name: publisher target: allTables: true publicationReclaimPolicy: delete In this case, deleting the Publication object also removes the publisher publication from the app database of the freddie cluster. Subscriptions In PostgreSQL's publish-and-subscribe replication model, a subscription represents the downstream component that consumes data changes. A subscription establishes the connection to a publisher's database and specifies the set of publications (one or more) it subscribes to. Subscriptions can be created on any supported PostgreSQL instance acting as the subscriber . Important Since schema definitions are not replicated, the subscriber must have the corresponding tables already defined before data replication begins. CloudNativePG simplifies subscription management by enabling you to define them declaratively using the Subscription resource. Info Please refer to the API reference for the full list of attributes you can define for each Subscription object. Suppose you want to replicate changes from the publisher publication on the app database of the freddie cluster ( publisher ) to the app database of the king cluster ( subscriber ). Here's an example of a Subscription manifest: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Subscription metadata: name: freddie-to-king-subscription spec: cluster: name: king dbname: app name: subscriber externalClusterName: freddie publicationName: publisher In the above example: The subscription object is named freddie-to-king-subscriber ( metadata.name ). The subscription is created in the app database ( spec.dbname ) of the king cluster ( spec.cluster.name ), with name subscriber ( spec.name ). It connects to the publisher publication in the external freddie cluster, referenced by spec.externalClusterName . To facilitate this setup, the freddie external cluster must be defined in the king cluster's configuration. Below is an example excerpt showing how to define the external cluster in the king manifest: externalClusters: - name: freddie connectionParameters: host: freddie-rw.default.svc user: postgres dbname: app Info For more details on configuring the externalClusters section, see the \"Bootstrap\" section of the documentation. As you can see, a subscription can connect to any PostgreSQL database accessible over the network. This flexibility allows you to seamlessly migrate your data into Kubernetes with nearly zero downtime. It\u2019s an excellent option for transitioning from various environments, including popular cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms. Required Fields in the Subscription Manifest The following fields are mandatory for defining a Subscription object: metadata.name : A unique name for the Kubernetes Subscription object within its namespace. spec.cluster.name : The name of the PostgreSQL cluster where the subscription will be created. spec.dbname : The name of the database in which the subscription will be created. spec.name : The name of the subscription as it will appear in PostgreSQL. spec.externalClusterName : The name of the external cluster, as defined in the spec.cluster.name cluster's configuration. This references the publisher database. spec.publicationName : The name of the publication in the publisher database to which the subscription will connect. The Subscription object must reference a specific Cluster , determining where the subscription will be managed. CloudNativePG ensures that the subscription is created or updated on the primary instance of the specified cluster. Reconciliation and Status After creating a Subscription , CloudNativePG manages it on the primary instance of the specified cluster. Following a successful reconciliation cycle, the Subscription status will reflect the following: applied: true , indicates the configuration has been successfully applied. observedGeneration matches metadata.generation , confirming the applied configuration corresponds to the most recent changes. If an error occurs during reconciliation, status.applied will be false , and an error message will be included in the status.message field. Removing a subscription The subscriptionReclaimPolicy field controls the behavior when deleting a Subscription object: retain (default): Leaves the subscription in PostgreSQL for manual management. delete : Automatically removes the subscription from PostgreSQL. Consider the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Subscription metadata: name: freddie-to-king-subscription spec: cluster: name: king dbname: app name: subscriber externalClusterName: freddie publicationName: publisher subscriptionReclaimPolicy: delete In this case, deleting the Subscription object also removes the subscriber subscription from the app database of the king cluster. Limitations Logical replication in PostgreSQL has some inherent limitations, as outlined in the official documentation . Notably, the following objects are not replicated: Database schema and DDL commands Sequence data Large objects Addressing Schema Replication The first limitation, related to schema replication, can be easily addressed using CloudNativePG's capabilities. For instance, you can leverage the import bootstrap feature to copy the schema of the tables you need to replicate. Alternatively, you can manually create the schema as you would for any PostgreSQL database. Handling Sequences While sequences are not automatically kept in sync through logical replication, CloudNativePG provides a solution to be used in live migrations. You can use the cnpg plugin to synchronize sequence values, ensuring consistency between the publisher and subscriber databases. Example of live migration and major Postgres upgrade with logical replication To highlight the powerful capabilities of logical replication, this example demonstrates how to replicate data from a publisher database ( freddie ) running PostgreSQL 16 to a subscriber database ( king ) running the latest PostgreSQL version. This setup can be deployed in your Kubernetes cluster for evaluation and hands-on learning. This example illustrates how logical replication facilitates live migrations and upgrades between PostgreSQL versions while ensuring data consistency. By combining logical replication with CloudNativePG, you can easily set up, manage, and evaluate such scenarios in a Kubernetes environment. Step 1: Setting Up the Publisher ( freddie ) The first step involves creating a freddie PostgreSQL cluster with version 16. The cluster contains a single instance and includes an app database initialized with a table, n , storing 10,000 numbers. A logical replication publication named publisher is also configured to include all tables in the database. Here\u2019s the manifest for setting up the freddie cluster and its publication resource: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: freddie spec: instances: 1 imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:16 storage: size: 1Gi bootstrap: initdb: postInitApplicationSQL: - CREATE TABLE n (i SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, m INTEGER) - INSERT INTO n (m) (SELECT generate_series(1, 10000)) - ALTER TABLE n OWNER TO app managed: roles: - name: app login: true replication: true --- apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Publication metadata: name: freddie-publisher spec: cluster: name: freddie dbname: app name: publisher target: allTables: true Step 2: Setting Up the Subscriber ( king ) Next, create the king PostgreSQL cluster, running the latest version of PostgreSQL. This cluster initializes by importing the schema from the app database on the freddie cluster using the external cluster configuration. A Subscription resource, freddie-to-king-subscription , is then configured to consume changes published by the publisher on freddie . Below is the manifest for setting up the king cluster and its subscription: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: king spec: instances: 1 storage: size: 1Gi bootstrap: initdb: import: type: microservice schemaOnly: true databases: - app source: externalCluster: freddie externalClusters: - name: freddie connectionParameters: host: freddie-rw.default.svc user: app dbname: app password: name: freddie-app key: password --- apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Subscription metadata: name: freddie-to-king-subscription spec: cluster: name: king dbname: app name: subscriber externalClusterName: freddie publicationName: publisher Once the king cluster is running, you can verify that the replication is working by connecting to the app database and counting the records in the n table. The following example uses the psql command provided by the cnpg plugin for simplicity: kubectl cnpg psql king -- app -qAt -c 'SELECT count(*) FROM n' 10000 This command should return 10000 , confirming that the data from the freddie cluster has been successfully replicated to the king cluster. Using the cnpg plugin, you can also synchronize existing sequences to ensure consistency between the publisher and subscriber. The example below demonstrates how to synchronize a sequence for the king cluster: kubectl cnpg subscription sync-sequences king --subscription=subscriber SELECT setval('\"public\".\"n_i_seq\"', 10000); 10000 This command updates the sequence n_i_seq in the king cluster to match the current value, ensuring it is in sync with the source database.","title":"Logical Replication"},{"location":"logical_replication/#logical-replication","text":"PostgreSQL extends its replication capabilities beyond physical replication, which operates at the level of exact block addresses and byte-by-byte copying, by offering logical replication . Logical replication replicates data objects and their changes based on a defined replication identity, typically the primary key. Logical replication uses a publish-and-subscribe model, where subscribers connect to publications on a publisher node. Subscribers pull data changes from these publications and can re-publish them, enabling cascading replication and complex topologies. This flexible model is particularly useful for: Online data migrations Live PostgreSQL version upgrades Data distribution across systems Real-time analytics Integration with external applications Info For more details, examples, and limitations, please refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation on Logical Replication .

Each publication is tied to a single database and provides fine-grained control over which tables and changes are replicated. For publishers outside Kubernetes, you can create publications using SQL or leverage the cnpg publication create plugin command . When managing Cluster objects with CloudNativePG , PostgreSQL publications can be defined declaratively through the Publication resource.

We assume they are correctly installed in your system. However, for experimentation we provide instructions in Part 4 of the Quickstart . Monitoring Instances For each PostgreSQL instance, the operator provides an exporter of metrics for Prometheus via HTTP or HTTPS, on port 9187, named metrics . The operator comes with a predefined set of metrics , as well as a highly configurable and customizable system to define additional queries via one or more ConfigMap or Secret resources (see the \"User defined metrics\" section below for details). Important CloudNativePG, by default, installs a set of predefined metrics in a ConfigMap named default-monitoring . Info You can inspect the exported metrics by following the instructions in the \"How to inspect the exported metrics\" section below. All monitoring queries that are performed on PostgreSQL are: atomic (one transaction per query) executed with the pg_monitor role executed with application_name set to cnpg_metrics_exporter executed as user postgres Please refer to the \"Predefined Roles\" section in PostgreSQL documentation for details on the pg_monitor role. Queries, by default, are run against the main database , as defined by the specified bootstrap method of the Cluster resource, according to the following logic: using initdb : queries will be run by default against the specified database in initdb.database , or app if not specified using recovery : queries will be run by default against the specified database in recovery.database , or postgres if not specified using pg_basebackup : queries will be run by default against the specified database in pg_basebackup.database , or postgres if not specified The default database can always be overridden for a given user-defined metric, by specifying a list of one or more databases in the target_databases option. Prometheus/Grafana If you are interested in evaluating the integration of CloudNativePG with Prometheus and Grafana, you can find a quick setup guide in Part 4 of the quickstart Prometheus Operator example A specific PostgreSQL cluster can be monitored using the Prometheus Operator's resource PodMonitor . A PodMonitor that correctly points to the Cluster can be automatically created by the operator by setting .spec.monitoring.enablePodMonitor to true in the Cluster resource itself (default: false ). Important Any change to the PodMonitor created automatically will be overridden by the Operator at the next reconciliation cycle, in case you need to customize it, you can do so as described below. To deploy a PodMonitor for a specific Cluster manually, define it as follows and adjust as needed: apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: PodMonitor metadata: name: cluster-example spec: selector: matchLabels: \"cnpg.io/cluster\": cluster-example podMetricsEndpoints: - port: metrics Important Ensure you modify the example above with a unique name, as well as the correct cluster's namespace and labels (e.g., cluster-example ). Important The postgresql label, used in previous versions of this document, is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Please use the cnpg.io/cluster label instead to select the instances. Enabling TLS on the Metrics Port To enable TLS communication on the metrics port, configure the .spec.monitoring.tls.enabled setting to true . This setup ensures that the metrics exporter uses the same server certificate used by PostgreSQL to secure communication on port 5432. Important Changing the .spec.monitoring.tls.enabled setting will trigger a rolling restart of the Cluster. If the PodMonitor is managed by the operator ( .spec.monitoring.enablePodMonitor set to true ), it will automatically contain the necessary configurations to access the metrics via TLS. To manually deploy a PodMonitor suitable for reading metrics via TLS, define it as follows and adjust as needed: apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: PodMonitor metadata: name: cluster-example spec: selector: matchLabels: \"cnpg.io/cluster\": cluster-example podMetricsEndpoints: - port: metrics scheme: https tlsConfig: ca: secret: name: cluster-example-ca key: ca.crt serverName: cluster-example-rw Important Ensure you modify the example above with a unique name, as well as the correct Cluster's namespace and labels (e.g., cluster-example ). Important The serverName field in the metrics endpoint must match one of the names defined in the server certificate. If the default certificate is in use, the serverName value should be in the format <cluster-name>-rw . Predefined set of metrics Every PostgreSQL instance exporter automatically exposes a set of predefined metrics, which can be classified in two major categories: PostgreSQL related metrics, starting with cnpg_collector_* , including: number of WAL files and total size on disk number of .ready and .done files in the archive status folder requested minimum and maximum number of synchronous replicas, as well as the expected and actually observed values number of distinct nodes accommodating the instances timestamps indicating last failed and last available backup, as well as the first point of recoverability for the cluster flag indicating if replica cluster mode is enabled or disabled flag indicating if a manual switchover is required flag indicating if fencing is enabled or disabled Go runtime related metrics, starting with go_* Below is a sample of the metrics returned by the localhost:9187/metrics endpoint of an instance.

The full semantic version Major.Minor.Patch can be found inside one of its label field named full . Note cnpg_collector_first_recoverability_point and cnpg_collector_last_available_backup_timestamp will be zero until your first backup to the object store. This is separate from the WAL archival. User defined metrics This feature is currently in beta state and the format is inspired by the queries.yaml file (release 0.12) of the PostgreSQL Prometheus Exporter. Custom metrics can be defined by users by referring to the created Configmap / Secret in a Cluster definition under the .spec.monitoring.customQueriesConfigMap or customQueriesSecret section as in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example namespace: test spec: instances: 3 storage: size: 1Gi monitoring: customQueriesConfigMap: - name: example-monitoring key: custom-queries The customQueriesConfigMap / customQueriesSecret sections contain a list of ConfigMap / Secret references specifying the key in which the custom queries are defined. Take care that the referred resources have to be created in the same namespace as the Cluster resource. Note If you want ConfigMaps and Secrets to be automatically reloaded by instances, you can add a label with key cnpg.io/reload to it, otherwise you will have to reload the instances using the kubectl cnpg reload subcommand. Important When a user defined metric overwrites an already existing metric the instance manager prints a json warning log, containing the message: Query with the same name already found. Overwriting the existing one. and a key queryName containing the overwritten query name. Example of a user defined metric Here you can see an example of a ConfigMap containing a single custom query, referenced by the Cluster example above: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: example-monitoring namespace: test labels: cnpg.io/reload: \"\" data: custom-queries: | pg_replication: query: \"SELECT CASE WHEN NOT pg_is_in_recovery() THEN 0 ELSE GREATEST (0, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp()))) END AS lag, pg_is_in_recovery() AS in_recovery, EXISTS (TABLE pg_stat_wal_receiver) AS is_wal_receiver_up, (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_replication) AS streaming_replicas\" metrics: - lag: usage: \"GAUGE\" description: \"Replication lag behind primary in seconds\" - in_recovery: usage: \"GAUGE\" description: \"Whether the instance is in recovery\" - is_wal_receiver_up: usage: \"GAUGE\" description: \"Whether the instance wal_receiver is up\" - streaming_replicas: usage: \"GAUGE\" description: \"Number of streaming replicas connected to the instance\" A list of basic monitoring queries can be found in the default-monitoring.yaml file that is already installed in your CloudNativePG deployment (see \"Default set of metrics\" ). Example of a user defined metric with predicate query The predicate_query option allows the user to execute the query to collect the metrics only under the specified conditions. To do so the user needs to provide a predicate query that returns at most one row with a single boolean column. The predicate query is executed in the same transaction as the main query and against the same databases. some_query: | predicate_query: | SELECT some_bool as predicate FROM some_table query: | SELECT count(*) as rows FROM some_table metrics: - rows: usage: \"GAUGE\" description: \"number of rows\" Example of a user defined metric running on multiple databases If the target_databases option lists more than one database the metric is collected from each of them. Database auto-discovery can be enabled for a specific query by specifying a shell-like pattern (i.e., containing * , ? or [] ) in the list of target_databases . If provided, the operator will expand the list of target databases by adding all the databases returned by the execution of SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datallowconn AND NOT datistemplate and matching the pattern according to path.Match() rules. Note The * character has a special meaning in yaml, so you need to quote ( \"*\" ) the target_databases value when it includes such a pattern. It is recommended that you always include the name of the database in the returned labels, for example using the current_database() function as in the following example: some_query: | query: | SELECT current_database() as datname, count(*) as rows FROM some_table metrics: - datname: usage: \"LABEL\" description: \"Name of current database\" - rows: usage: \"GAUGE\" description: \"number of rows\" target_databases: - albert - bb - freddie This will produce in the following metric being exposed: cnpg_some_query_rows{datname=\"albert\"} 2 cnpg_some_query_rows{datname=\"bb\"} 5 cnpg_some_query_rows{datname=\"freddie\"} 10 Here is an example of a query with auto-discovery enabled which also runs on the template1 database (otherwise not returned by the aforementioned query): some_query: | query: | SELECT current_database() as datname, count(*) as rows FROM some_table metrics: - datname: usage: \"LABEL\" description: \"Name of current database\" - rows: usage: \"GAUGE\" description: \"number of rows\" target_databases: - \"*\" - \"template1\" The above example will produce the following metrics (provided the databases exist): cnpg_some_query_rows{datname=\"albert\"} 2 cnpg_some_query_rows{datname=\"bb\"} 5 cnpg_some_query_rows{datname=\"freddie\"} 10 cnpg_some_query_rows{datname=\"template1\"} 7 cnpg_some_query_rows{datname=\"postgres\"} 42 Structure of a user defined metric Every custom query has the following basic structure: <MetricName>: query: \"<SQLQuery>\" metrics: - <ColumnName>: usage: \"<MetricType>\" description: \"<MetricDescription>\" Here is a short description of all the available fields: <MetricName> : the name of the Prometheus metric name : override <MetricName> , if defined query : the SQL query to run on the target database to generate the metrics primary : whether to run the query only on the primary instance master : same as primary (for compatibility with the Prometheus PostgreSQL exporter's syntax - deprecated) runonserver : a semantic version range to limit the versions of PostgreSQL the query should run on (e.g. \">=11.0.0\" or \">=12.0.0 <=15.0.0\" ) target_databases : a list of databases to run the query against, or a shell-like pattern to enable auto discovery. Overwrites the default database if provided. predicate_query : a SQL query that returns at most one row and one boolean column to run on the target database. The system evaluates the predicate and if true executes the query . metrics : section containing a list of all exported columns, defined as follows: <ColumnName> : the name of the column returned by the query name : override the ColumnName of the column in the metric, if defined usage : one of the values described below description : the metric's description metrics_mapping : the optional column mapping when usage is set to MAPPEDMETRIC The possible values for usage are: Column Usage Label Description DISCARD this column should be ignored LABEL use this column as a label COUNTER use this column as a counter GAUGE use this column as a gauge MAPPEDMETRIC use this column with the supplied mapping of text values DURATION use this column as a text duration (in milliseconds) HISTOGRAM use this column as a histogram Please visit the \"Metric Types\" page from the Prometheus documentation for more information. Output of a user defined metric Custom defined metrics are returned by the Prometheus exporter endpoint ( :9187/metrics ) with the following format: cnpg_<MetricName>_<ColumnName>{<LabelColumnName>=<LabelColumnValue> ... } <ColumnValue> Note LabelColumnName are metrics with usage set to LABEL and their Value Considering the pg_replication example above, the exporter's endpoint would return the following output when invoked: # HELP cnpg_pg_replication_in_recovery Whether the instance is in recovery # TYPE cnpg_pg_replication_in_recovery gauge cnpg_pg_replication_in_recovery 0 # HELP cnpg_pg_replication_lag Replication lag behind primary in seconds # TYPE cnpg_pg_replication_lag gauge cnpg_pg_replication_lag 0 # HELP cnpg_pg_replication_streaming_replicas Number of streaming replicas connected to the instance # TYPE cnpg_pg_replication_streaming_replicas gauge cnpg_pg_replication_streaming_replicas 2 # HELP cnpg_pg_replication_is_wal_receiver_up Whether the instance wal_receiver is up # TYPE cnpg_pg_replication_is_wal_receiver_up gauge cnpg_pg_replication_is_wal_receiver_up 0 Default set of metrics The operator can be configured to automatically inject in a Cluster a set of monitoring queries defined in a ConfigMap or a Secret, inside the operator's namespace. You have to set the MONITORING_QUERIES_CONFIGMAP or MONITORING_QUERIES_SECRET key in the \"operator configuration\" , respectively to the name of the ConfigMap or the Secret; the operator will then use the content of the queries key. Any change to the queries content will be immediately reflected on all the deployed Clusters using it. The operator installation manifests come with a predefined ConfigMap, called cnpg-default-monitoring , to be used by all Clusters. MONITORING_QUERIES_CONFIGMAP is by default set to cnpg-default-monitoring in the operator configuration. If you want to disable the default set of metrics, you can: - disable it at operator level: set the MONITORING_QUERIES_CONFIGMAP / MONITORING_QUERIES_SECRET key to \"\" (empty string), in the operator ConfigMap. Changes to operator ConfigMap require an operator restart. - disable it for a specific Cluster: set .spec.monitoring.disableDefaultQueries to true in the Cluster. Important The ConfigMap or Secret specified via MONITORING_QUERIES_CONFIGMAP / MONITORING_QUERIES_SECRET will always be copied to the Cluster's namespace with a fixed name: cnpg-default-monitoring . So that, if you intend to have default metrics, you should not create a ConfigMap with this name in the cluster's namespace. Differences with the Prometheus Postgres exporter CloudNativePG is inspired by the PostgreSQL Prometheus Exporter, but presents some differences. In particular, the cache_seconds field is not implemented in CloudNativePG's exporter. Monitoring the operator The operator internally exposes Prometheus metrics via HTTP on port 8080, named metrics . Info You can inspect the exported metrics by following the instructions in the \"How to inspect the exported metrics\" section below. Currently, the operator exposes default kubebuilder metrics, see kubebuilder documentation for more details. Prometheus Operator example The operator deployment can be monitored using the Prometheus Operator by defining the following PodMonitor resource: apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: PodMonitor metadata: name: cnpg-controller-manager spec: selector: matchLabels: app.kubernetes.io/name: cloudnative-pg podMetricsEndpoints: - port: metrics How to inspect the exported metrics In this section we provide some basic instructions on how to inspect the metrics exported by a specific PostgreSQL instance manager (primary or replica) or the operator, using a temporary pod running curl in the same namespace. Note In the example below we assume we are working in the default namespace, alongside with the PostgreSQL cluster. Please feel free to adapt this example to your use case, by applying basic Kubernetes knowledge. Create the curl.yaml file with this content: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: curl spec: containers: - name: curl image: curlimages/curl:8.2.1 command: ['sleep', '3600'] Then create the pod: kubectl apply -f curl.yaml In case you want to inspect the metrics exported by an instance, you need to connect to port 9187 of the target pod. This is the generic command to be run (make sure you use the correct IP for the pod): kubectl exec -ti curl -- curl -s <pod_ip>:9187/metrics For example, if your PostgreSQL cluster is called cluster-example and you want to retrieve the exported metrics of the first pod in the cluster, you can run the following command to programmatically get the IP of that pod: POD_IP=$(kubectl get pod cluster-example-1 --template '{{.status.podIP}}') And then run: kubectl exec -ti curl -- curl -s ${POD_IP}:9187/metrics If you enabled TLS metrics, run instead: kubectl exec -ti curl -- curl -sk https://${POD_IP}:9187/metrics In case you want to access the metrics of the operator, you need to point to the pod where the operator is running, and use TCP port 8080 as target. At the end of the inspection, please make sure you delete the curl pod: kubectl delete -f curl.yaml Auxiliary resources Important These resources are provided for illustration and experimentation, and do not represent any kind of recommendation for your production system In the doc/src/samples/monitoring/ directory you will find a series of sample files for observability. Please refer to Part 4 of the quickstart section for context: kube-stack-config.yaml : a configuration file for the kube-stack helm chart installation. It ensures that Prometheus listens for all PodMonitor resources. prometheusrule.yaml : a PrometheusRule with alerts for CloudNativePG. NOTE: this does not include inter-operation with notification services. Please refer to the Prometheus documentation . podmonitor.yaml : a PodMonitor for the CloudNativePG Operator deployment. In addition, we provide the \"raw\" sources for the Prometheus alert rules in the alerts.yaml file. The Grafana dashboard has a dedicated repository now. Note that, for the configuration of kube-prometheus-stack , other fields and settings are available over what we provide in kube-stack-config.yaml .

The operator comes with a predefined set of metrics , as well as a highly configurable and customizable system to define additional queries via one or more ConfigMap or Secret resources (see the \"User defined metrics\" section below for details). Important CloudNativePG, by default, installs a set of predefined metrics in a ConfigMap named default-monitoring . Info You can inspect the exported metrics by following the instructions in the \"How to inspect the exported metrics\" section below. All monitoring queries that are performed on PostgreSQL are: atomic (one transaction per query) executed with the pg_monitor role executed with application_name set to cnpg_metrics_exporter executed as user postgres Please refer to the \"Predefined Roles\" section in PostgreSQL documentation for details on the pg_monitor role. Queries, by default, are run against the main database , as defined by the specified bootstrap method of the Cluster resource, according to the following logic: using initdb : queries will be run by default against the specified database in initdb.database , or app if not specified using recovery : queries will be run by default against the specified database in recovery.database , or postgres if not specified using pg_basebackup : queries will be run by default against the specified database in pg_basebackup.database , or postgres if not specified The default database can always be overridden for a given user-defined metric, by specifying a list of one or more databases in the target_databases option.

Important Based on the Operator Capability Levels model , you can expect a \"Level V - Auto Pilot\" set of capabilities from the CloudNativePG operator. Each capability level is associated with a certain set of management features the operator offers: Basic install Seamless upgrades Full lifecycle Deep insights Auto pilot Note We consider this framework as a guide for future work and implementations in the operator. Level 1: Basic install Capability level 1 involves installing and configuring the operator. This category includes usability and user experience enhancements, such as improvements in how you interact with the operator and a PostgreSQL cluster configuration. Important We consider information security part of this level. Operator deployment via declarative configuration The operator is installed in a declarative way using a Kubernetes manifest that defines four major CustomResourceDefinition objects: Cluster , Pooler , Backup , and ScheduledBackup . PostgreSQL cluster deployment via declarative configuration You define a PostgreSQL cluster (operand) using the Cluster custom resource in a fully declarative way. The PostgreSQL version is determined by the operand container image defined in the CR, which is automatically fetched from the requested registry. When deploying an operand, the operator also creates the following resources: Pod , Service , Secret , ConfigMap , PersistentVolumeClaim , PodDisruptionBudget , ServiceAccount , RoleBinding , and Role . Override of operand images through the CRD The operator is designed to support any operand container image with PostgreSQL inside. By default, the operator uses the latest available minor version of the latest stable major version supported by the PostgreSQL community and published on ghcr.io. You can use any compatible image of PostgreSQL supporting the primary/standby architecture directly by setting the imageName attribute in the CR. The operator also supports imagePullSecrets to access private container registries, and it supports digests and tags for finer control of container image immutability. If you prefer not to specify an image name, you can leverage image catalogs by simply referencing the PostgreSQL major version. Moreover, image catalogs enable you to effortlessly create custom catalogs, directing to images based on your specific requirements. Labels and annotations You can configure the operator to support inheriting labels and annotations that are defined in a cluster's metadata. The goal is to improve the organization of the CloudNativePG deployment in your Kubernetes infrastructure. Self-contained instance manager Instead of relying on an external tool to coordinate PostgreSQL instances in the Kubernetes cluster pods, such as Patroni or Stolon, the operator injects the operator executable inside each pod, in a file named /controller/manager . The application is used to control the underlying PostgreSQL instance and to reconcile the pod status with the instance based on the PostgreSQL cluster topology. The instance manager also starts a web server that's invoked by the kubelet for probes. Unix signals invoked by the kubelet are filtered by the instance manager. Where appropriate, they're forwarded to the postgres process for fast and controlled reactions to external events. The instance manager is written in Go and has no external dependencies. Storage configuration Storage is a critical component in a database workload. Taking advantage of the Kubernetes native capabilities and resources in terms of storage, the operator gives you enough flexibility to choose the right storage for your workload requirements, based on what the underlying Kubernetes environment can offer. This implies choosing a particular storage class in a public cloud environment or fine-tuning the generated PVC through a PVC template in the CR's storage parameter. For better performance and finer control, you can also choose to host your cluster's write-ahead log (WAL, also known as pg_wal ) on a separate volume, preferably on different storage. The \"Benchmarking\" section of the documentation provides detailed instructions on benchmarking both storage and the database before production. It relies on the cnpg plugin to ensure optimal performance and reliability. Replica configuration The operator detects replicas in a cluster through a single parameter, called instances . If set to 1 , the cluster comprises a single primary PostgreSQL instance with no replica. If higher than 1 , the operator manages instances -1 replicas, including high availability (HA) through automated failover and rolling updates through switchover operations. CloudNativePG manages replication slots for all the replicas in the HA cluster. The implementation is inspired by the previously proposed patch for PostgreSQL, called failover slots , and also supports user defined physical replication slots on the primary. Service Configuration By default, CloudNativePG creates three Kubernetes services for applications to access the cluster via the network: One pointing to the primary for read/write operations. One pointing to replicas for read-only queries. A generic one pointing to any instance for read operations. You can disable the read-only and read services via configuration. Additionally, you can leverage the service template capability to create custom service resources, including load balancers, to access PostgreSQL outside Kubernetes. This is particularly useful for DBaaS purposes. Database configuration The operator is designed to bootstrap a PostgreSQL cluster with a single database. The operator transparently manages network access to the cluster through three Kubernetes services provisioned and managed for read-write, read, and read-only workloads. Using the convention-over-configuration approach, the operator creates a database called app , by default owned by a regular Postgres user with the same name. You can specify both the database name and the user name, if required, as part of the bootstrap. Additional databases can be created or managed via declarative database management using the Database CRD, also supporting extensions and schemas. Although no configuration is required to run the cluster, you can customize both PostgreSQL runtime configuration and PostgreSQL host-based authentication rules in the postgresql section of the CR. Configuration of Postgres roles, users, and groups CloudNativePG supports management of PostgreSQL roles, users, and groups through declarative configuration using the .spec.managed.roles stanza. Pod security standards For InfoSec requirements, the operator doesn't require privileged mode for any container. It enforces a read-only root filesystem to guarantee containers immutability for both the operator and the operand pods. It also explicitly sets the required security contexts. Affinity The cluster's affinity section enables fine-tuning of how pods and related resources, such as persistent volumes, are scheduled across the nodes of a Kubernetes cluster. In particular, the operator supports: Pod affinity and anti-affinity Node selector Taints and tolerations Topology spread constraints The cluster's topologySpreadConstraints section enables additional control of scheduling pods across topologies, enhancing what affinity and anti-affinity can offer. Command-line interface CloudNativePG doesn't have its own command-line interface. It relies on the best command-line interface for Kubernetes, kubectl, by providing a plugin called cnpg . This plugin enhances and simplifies your PostgreSQL cluster management experience. Current status of the cluster The operator continuously updates the status section of the CR with the observed status of the cluster. The entire PostgreSQL cluster status is continuously monitored by the instance manager running in each pod. The instance manager is responsible for applying the required changes to the controlled PostgreSQL instance to converge to the required status of the cluster. (For example, if the cluster status reports that pod -1 is the primary, pod -1 needs to promote itself while the other pods need to follow pod -1 .) The same status is used by the cnpg plugin for kubectl to provide details. Operator's certification authority The operator creates a certification authority for itself. It creates and signs with the operator certification authority a leaf certificate for the webhook server to use. This certificate ensures safe communication between the Kubernetes API server and the operator. Cluster's certification authority The operator creates a certification authority for every PostgreSQL cluster. This certification authority is used to issue and renew TLS certificates for clients' authentication, including streaming replication standby servers (instead of passwords). Support for a custom certification authority for client certificates is available through secrets, which also includes integration with cert-manager. Certificates can be issued with the cnpg plugin for kubectl. TLS connections The operator transparently and natively supports TLS/SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications for increased security using the cluster's certification authority. Support for custom server certificates is available through secrets, which also includes integration with cert-manager. Certificate authentication for streaming replication To authorize streaming replication connections from the standby servers, the operator relies on TLS client certificate authentication. This method is used instead of relying on a password (and therefore a secret). Continuous configuration management The operator enables you to apply changes to the Cluster resource YAML section of the PostgreSQL configuration. Depending on the configuration option, it also makes sure that all instances are properly reloaded or restarted. Note Changes with ALTER SYSTEM aren't detected, meaning that the cluster state isn't enforced. Import of existing PostgreSQL databases The operator provides a declarative way to import existing Postgres databases in a new CloudNativePG cluster in Kubernetes, using offline migrations. The same feature also covers offline major upgrades of PostgreSQL databases. Offline means that applications must stop their write operations at the source until the database is imported. The feature extends the initdb bootstrap method to create a new PostgreSQL cluster using a logical snapshot of the data available in another PostgreSQL database. This data can be accessed by way of the network through a superuser connection. Import is from any supported version of Postgres. It relies on pg_dump and pg_restore being executed from the new cluster primary for all databases that are part of the operation and, if requested, for roles. PostGIS clusters CloudNativePG supports the installation of clusters with the PostGIS open source extension for geographical databases. This extension is one of the most popular extensions for PostgreSQL. Basic LDAP authentication for PostgreSQL The operator allows you to configure LDAP authentication for your PostgreSQL clients, using either the simple bind or search+bind mode, as described in the LDAP authentication section of the PostgreSQL documentation . Multiple installation methods The operator can be installed through a Kubernetes manifest by way of kubectl apply , to be used in a traditional Kubernetes installation in public and private cloud environments. CloudNativePG also supports installation by way of a Helm chart or OLM bundle from OperatorHub.io. Convention over configuration The operator supports the convention-over-configuration paradigm, deciding standard default values while allowing you to override them and customize them. You can specify a deployment of a PostgreSQL cluster using the Cluster CRD in a couple of lines of YAML code. Level 2: Seamless upgrades Capability level 2 is about enabling updates of the operator and the actual workload, in this case PostgreSQL servers. This includes PostgreSQL minor release updates (security and bug fixes normally) as well as major online upgrades. Operator Upgrade Upgrading the operator is seamless and can be done as a new deployment. After upgrading the controller, a rolling update of all deployed PostgreSQL clusters is initiated. You can choose to update all clusters simultaneously or distribute their upgrades over time. Thanks to the instance manager's injection, upgrading the operator does not require changes to the operand, allowing the operator to manage older versions of it. Additionally, CloudNativePG supports in-place updates of the instance manager following an operator upgrade. In-place updates do not require a rolling update or a subsequent switchover of the cluster. Upgrade of the managed workload The operand can be upgraded using a declarative configuration approach as part of changing the CR and, in particular, the imageName parameter. This is normally initiated by security updates or Postgres minor version updates. In the presence of standby servers, the operator performs rolling updates starting from the replicas. It does this by dropping the existing pod and creating a new one with the new requested operand image that reuses the underlying storage. Depending on the value of the primaryUpdateStrategy , the operator proceeds with a switchover before updating the former primary ( unsupervised ). Or, it waits for the user to manually issue the switchover procedure ( supervised ) by way of the cnpg plugin for kubectl. The setting to use depends on the business requirements, as the operation might generate some downtime for the applications. This downtime can range from a few seconds to minutes, based on the actual database workload. Offline In-Place Major Upgrades of PostgreSQL CloudNativePG supports declarative offline in-place major upgrades when a new operand container image with a higher PostgreSQL major version is applied to a cluster. The upgrade can be triggered by updating the image tag via the .spec.imageName option or by using an image catalog to manage version changes. During the upgrade, all cluster pods are shut down to ensure data consistency. A new job is then created to validate the upgrade conditions, execute pg_upgrade , and create new directories for PGDATA , WAL files, and tablespaces if needed. Once the upgrade is complete, replicas are re-created. Failed upgrades can be rolled back. Display cluster availability status during upgrade At any time, convey the cluster's high availability status, for example, Setting up primary , Creating a new replica , Cluster in healthy state , Switchover in progress , Failing over , Upgrading cluster , and Upgrading Postgres major version . Level 3: Full lifecycle Capability level 3 requires the operator to manage aspects of business continuity and scalability. Disaster recovery is a business continuity component that requires that both backup and recovery of a database work correctly. While as a starting point, the goal is to achieve RPO < 5 minutes, the long-term goal is to implement RPO=0 backup solutions. High availability is the other important component of business continuity. Through PostgreSQL native physical replication and hot standby replicas, it allows the operator to perform failover and switchover operations. This area includes enhancements in: Control of PostgreSQL physical replication, such as synchronous replication, (cascading) replication clusters, and so on Connection pooling, to improve performance and control through a connection pooling layer with pgBouncer PostgreSQL WAL archive The operator supports PostgreSQL continuous archiving of WAL files to an object store (AWS S3 and S3-compatible, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and gateways like MinIO). WAL archiving is defined at the cluster level, declaratively, through the backup parameter in the cluster definition. This is done by specifying an S3 protocol destination URL (for example, to point to a specific folder in an AWS S3 bucket) and, optionally, a generic endpoint URL. WAL archiving, a prerequisite for continuous backup, doesn't require any further user action. The operator transparently sets the archive_command to rely on barman-cloud-wal-archive to ship WAL files to the defined endpoint. You can decide the compression algorithm, as well as the number of parallel jobs to concurrently upload WAL files in the archive. In addition, Instance Manager checks the correctness of the archive destination by performing the barman-cloud-check-wal-archive command before beginning to ship the first set of WAL files. PostgreSQL backups The operator was designed to provide application-level backups using PostgreSQL\u2019s native continuous hot backup technology based on physical base backups and continuous WAL archiving. Base backups can be saved on: Kubernetes volume snapshots Object stores (AWS S3 and S3-compatible, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and gateways like MinIO) Base backups are defined at the cluster level, declaratively, through the backup parameter in the cluster definition. You can define base backups in two ways: On-demand, through the Backup custom resource definition Scheduled, through the ScheduledBackup custom resource definition, using a cron-like syntax Volume snapshots rely directly on the Kubernetes API, which delegates this capability to the underlying storage classes and CSI drivers. Volume snapshot backups are suitable for very large database (VLDB) contexts. Object store backups rely on barman-cloud-backup for the job (distributed as part of the application container image) to relay backups in the same endpoint, alongside WAL files. Both barman-cloud-wal-restore and barman-cloud-backup are distributed in the application container image under GNU GPL 3 terms. Object store backups and volume snapshot backups are taken while PostgreSQL is up and running (hot backups). Volume snapshots also support taking consistent database snapshots with cold backups. Backups from a standby The operator supports offloading base backups onto a standby without impacting the RPO of the database. This allows resources to be preserved on the primary, in particular I/O, for standard database operations. Full restore from a backup The operator enables you to bootstrap a new cluster (with its settings) starting from an existing and accessible backup, either on a volume snapshot or in an object store. Once the bootstrap process is completed, the operator initiates the instance in recovery mode. It replays all available WAL files from the specified archive, exiting recovery and starting as a primary. Subsequently, the operator clones the requested number of standby instances from the primary. CloudNativePG supports parallel WAL fetching from the archive. Point-in-time recovery (PITR) from a backup The operator enables you to create a new PostgreSQL cluster by recovering an existing backup to a specific point in time, defined with a timestamp, a label, or a transaction ID. This capability is built on top of the full restore one and supports all the options available in PostgreSQL for PITR . Zero-Data-Loss Clusters Through Synchronous Replication Achieve zero data loss (RPO=0) in your local high-availability CloudNativePG cluster with support for both quorum-based and priority-based synchronous replication. The operator offers a flexible way to define the number of expected synchronous standby replicas available at any time, and allows customization of the synchronous_standby_names option as needed. Replica clusters Establish a robust cross-Kubernetes cluster topology for PostgreSQL clusters, harnessing the power of native streaming and cascading replication. With the replica option, you can configure an autonomous cluster to consistently replicate data from another PostgreSQL source of the same major version. This source can be located anywhere, provided you have access to a WAL archive for fetching WAL files or a direct streaming connection via TLS between the two endpoints. Notably, the source PostgreSQL instance can exist outside the Kubernetes environment, whether in a physical or virtual setting. Replica clusters can be instantiated through various methods, including volume snapshots, a recovery object store (using the Barman Cloud backup format), or streaming using pg_basebackup . Both WAL file shipping and WAL streaming are supported. The deployment of replica clusters significantly elevates the business continuity posture of PostgreSQL databases within Kubernetes, extending across multiple data centers and facilitating hybrid and multi-cloud setups. (While anticipating Kubernetes federation native capabilities, manual switchover across data centers remains necessary.) Additionally, the flexibility extends to creating delayed replica clusters intentionally lagging behind the primary cluster. This intentional lag aims to minimize the Recovery Time Objective ( RTO ) in the event of unintended errors, such as incorrect DELETE or UPDATE SQL operations. Distributed Database Topologies Leverage replica clusters to define distributed database topologies for PostgreSQL that span across various Kubernetes clusters, facilitating hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. With CloudNativePG, you gain powerful capabilities, including: Declarative Primary Control : Easily specify which PostgreSQL cluster acts as the primary. Seamless Primary Switchover : Effortlessly demote the current primary and promote another PostgreSQL cluster, typically located in a different region, without needing to re-clone the former primary. This setup can efficiently operate across two or more regions, can rely entirely on object stores for replication, and guarantees a maximum RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of 5 minutes. This advanced feature is uniquely provided by CloudNativePG, ensuring robust data integrity and continuity across diverse environments. Tablespace support CloudNativePG seamlessly integrates robust support for PostgreSQL tablespaces by facilitating the declarative definition of individual persistent volumes. This innovative feature empowers you to efficiently distribute I/O operations across a diverse array of storage devices. Through the transparent orchestration of tablespaces, CloudNativePG enhances the performance and scalability of PostgreSQL databases, ensuring a streamlined and optimized experience for managing large scale data storage in cloud-native environments. Support for temporary tablespaces is also included. Startup, Liveness, and Readiness Probes CloudNativePG configures startup, liveness, and readiness probes for PostgreSQL containers, which are managed by the Kubernetes kubelet. These probes interact with the /healthz and /readyz endpoints exposed by the instance manager's web server to monitor the Pod's health and readiness. The startup and liveness probes use the pg_isready utility. A Pod is considered healthy if pg_isready returns an exit code of 0 (indicating the server is accepting connections) or 1 (indicating the server is rejecting connections, such as during startup). The readiness probe executes a simple SQL query ( ; ) to verify that the PostgreSQL server is ready to accept client connections. All probes are configured with default settings but can be fully customized to meet specific needs, allowing for fine-tuning to align with your environment and workloads. Rolling deployments The operator supports rolling deployments to minimize the downtime. If a PostgreSQL cluster is exposed publicly, the service load-balances the read-only traffic only to available pods during the initialization or the update. Scale up and down of replicas The operator allows you to scale up and down the number of instances in a PostgreSQL cluster. New replicas are started up from the primary server and participate in the cluster's HA infrastructure. The CRD declares a \"scale\" subresource that allows you to use the kubectl scale command. Maintenance window and PodDisruptionBudget for Kubernetes nodes The operator creates a PodDisruptionBudget resource to limit the number of concurrent disruptions to one primary instance. This configuration prevents the maintenance operation from deleting all the pods in a cluster, allowing the specified number of instances to be created. The PodDisruptionBudget is applied during the node-draining operation, preventing any disruption of the cluster service. While this strategy is correct for Kubernetes clusters where storage is shared among all the worker nodes, it might not be the best solution for clusters using local storage or for clusters installed in a private cloud. The operator allows you to specify a maintenance window and configure the reaction to any underlying node eviction. The ReusePVC option in the maintenance window section enables to specify the strategy to use. Allocate new storage in a different PVC for the evicted instance, or wait for the underlying node to be available again. Fencing Fencing is the process of protecting the data in one, more, or even all instances of a PostgreSQL cluster when they appear to be malfunctioning. When an instance is fenced, the PostgreSQL server process is guaranteed to be shut down, while the pod is kept running. This ensures that, until the fence is lifted, data on the pod isn't modified by PostgreSQL and that you can investigate file system for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Hibernation (declarative) CloudNativePG supports hibernation of a running PostgreSQL cluster in a declarative manner, through the cnpg.io/hibernation annotation. Hibernation enables saving CPU power by removing the database pods while keeping the database PVCs. This feature simulates scaling to 0 instances. Hibernation (imperative) CloudNativePG supports hibernation of a running PostgreSQL cluster by way of the cnpg plugin. Hibernation shuts down all Postgres instances in the high-availability cluster and keeps a static copy of the PVC group of the primary. The copy contains PGDATA and WALs. The plugin enables you to exit the hibernation phase by resuming the primary and then recreating all the replicas, if they exist. Reuse of persistent volumes storage in pods When the operator needs to create a pod that was deleted by the user or was evicted by a Kubernetes maintenance operation, it reuses the PersistentVolumeClaim , if available. This ability avoids the need to clone the data from the primary again. CPU and memory requests and limits The operator allows administrators to control and manage resource usage by the cluster's pods in the resources section of the manifest. In particular, you can set requests and limits values for both CPU and RAM. Connection pooling with PgBouncer CloudNativePG provides native support for connection pooling with PgBouncer , one of the most popular open source connection poolers for PostgreSQL. From an architectural point of view, the native implementation of a PgBouncer connection pooler introduces a new layer to access the database. This optimizes the query flow toward the instances and makes the use of the underlying PostgreSQL resources more efficient. Instead of connecting directly to a PostgreSQL service, applications can now connect to the PgBouncer service and start reusing any existing connection. Logical Replication CloudNativePG supports PostgreSQL's logical replication in a declarative manner using Publication and Subscription custom resource definitions. Logical replication is particularly useful together with the import facility for online data migrations (even from public DBaaS solutions) and major PostgreSQL upgrades. Level 4: Deep insights Capability level 4 is about observability : monitoring, alerting, trending, and log processing. This might involve the use of external tools, such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Fluent Bit, as well as extensions in the PostgreSQL engine for the output of error logs directly in JSON format. CloudNativePG was designed to provide everything needed to easily integrate with industry-standard and community-accepted tools for flexible monitoring and logging. Prometheus exporter with configurable queries The instance manager provides a pluggable framework. By way of its own web server listening on the metrics port (9187), it exposes an endpoint to export metrics for the Prometheus monitoring and alerting tool. The operator supports custom monitoring queries defined as ConfigMap or Secret objects using a syntax that's compatible with postgres_exporter for Prometheus . CloudNativePG provides a set of basic monitoring queries for PostgreSQL that can be integrated and adapted to your context. Grafana dashboard CloudNativePG comes with a Grafana dashboard that you can use as a base to monitor all critical aspects of a PostgreSQL cluster, and customize. Standard output logging of PostgreSQL error messages in JSON format Every log message is delivered to standard output in JSON format. The first level is the definition of the timestamp, the log level, and the type of log entry, such as postgres for the canonical PostgreSQL error message channel. As a result, every pod managed by CloudNativePG can be easily and directly integrated with any downstream log processing stack that supports JSON as source data type. Real-time query monitoring CloudNativePG transparently and natively supports: The essential pg_stat_statements extension , which enables tracking of planning and execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by a PostgreSQL server The auto_explain extension , which provides a means for logging execution plans of slow statements automatically, without having to manually run EXPLAIN (helpful for tracking down un-optimized queries) The pg_failover_slots extension , which makes logical replication slots usable across a physical failover, ensuring resilience in change data capture (CDC) contexts based on PostgreSQL's native logical replication Audit CloudNativePG allows database and security administrators, auditors, and operators to track and analyze database activities using PGAudit for PostgreSQL. Such activities flow directly in the JSON log and can be properly routed to the correct downstream target using common log brokers like Fluentd. Kubernetes events Record major events as expected by the Kubernetes API, such as creating resources, removing nodes, and upgrading. Events can be displayed by using the kubectl describe and kubectl get events commands. Level 5: Auto pilot Capability level 5 is focused on automated scaling, healing, and tuning through the discovery of anomalies and insights that emerged from the observability layer. Automated failover for self-healing In case of detected failure on the primary, the operator changes the status of the cluster by setting the most aligned replica as the new target primary. As a consequence, the instance manager in each alive pod initiates the required procedures to align itself with the requested status of the cluster. It does this by either becoming the new primary or by following it. In case the former primary comes back up, the same mechanism avoids a split-brain by preventing applications from reaching it, running pg_rewind on the server and restarting it as a standby. Automated recreation of a standby If the pod hosting a standby is removed, the operator initiates the procedure to re-create a standby server.","title":"Operator capability levels"},{"location":"operator_capability_levels/#operator-capability-levels","text":"These capabilities were implemented by CloudNativePG, classified using the Operator SDK definition of Capability Levels framework.

A Pod is considered healthy if pg_isready returns an exit code of 0 (indicating the server is accepting connections) or 1 (indicating the server is rejecting connections, such as during startup). The readiness probe executes a simple SQL query ( ; ) to verify that the PostgreSQL server is ready to accept client connections.

Note In the examples below we assume the default name and namespace for the operator deployment. The behavior of the operator can be customized through a ConfigMap / Secret that is located in the same namespace of the operator deployment and with cnpg-controller-manager-config as the name. Important Any change to the config's ConfigMap / Secret will not be automatically detected by the operator, - and as such, it needs to be reloaded (see below).

Important This section assumes you are familiar with PostGIS and provides some basic information about how to create a new PostgreSQL cluster with a PostGIS database in Kubernetes via CloudNativePG. The CloudNativePG Community maintains container images that are built on top of the official PostGIS images hosted on DockerHub . For more information please visit: The postgis-containers project in GitHub The postgis-containers Container Registry in GitHub Basic concepts about a PostGIS cluster Conceptually, a PostGIS-based PostgreSQL cluster (or simply a PostGIS cluster) is like any other PostgreSQL cluster. The only differences are: the presence in the system of PostGIS and related libraries the presence in the database(s) of the PostGIS extension Since CloudNativePG is based on Immutable Application Containers, the only way to provision PostGIS is to add it to the container image that you use for the operand. The \"Container Image Requirements\" section provides detailed instructions on how this is achieved. More simply, you can just use the PostGIS container images from the Community, as in the examples below. The second step is to install the extension in the PostgreSQL database. You can do this in two ways: install it in the application database, which is the main and supposedly only database you host in the cluster according to the microservice architecture, or install it in the template1 database so as to make it available for all the databases you end up creating in the cluster, in case you adopt the monolith architecture where the instance is shared by multiple databases Info For more information on the microservice vs monolith architecture in the database please refer to the \"How many databases should be hosted in a single PostgreSQL instance?\" FAQ or the \"Database import\" section . Create a new PostgreSQL cluster with PostGIS Let's suppose you want to create a new PostgreSQL 17 cluster with PostGIS 3.2. The first step is to ensure you use the right PostGIS container image for the operand, and properly set the .spec.imageName option in the Cluster resource. The postgis-example.yaml manifest below provides some guidance on how the creation of a PostGIS cluster can be done. Warning Please consider that, although convention over configuration applies in CloudNativePG, you should spend time configuring and tuning your system for production. Also the imageName in the example below deliberately points to the latest available image for PostgreSQL 17 - you should use a specific image name or, preferably, the SHA256 digest for true immutability. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: postgis-example spec: instances: 1 imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgis:17 storage: size: 1Gi postgresql: parameters: log_statement: ddl --- apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Database metadata: name: postgis-example-app spec: name: app owner: app cluster: name: postgis-example extensions: - name: postgis - name: postgis_topology - name: fuzzystrmatch - name: postgis_tiger_geocoder The example leverages the Database resource's declarative extension management to add the specified extensions to the app database.

You can do this in two ways: install it in the application database, which is the main and supposedly only database you host in the cluster according to the microservice architecture, or install it in the template1 database so as to make it available for all the databases you end up creating in the cluster, in case you adopt the monolith architecture where the instance is shared by multiple databases Info For more information on the microservice vs monolith architecture in the database please refer to the \"How many databases should be hosted in a single PostgreSQL instance?\" FAQ or the \"Database import\" section .","title":"Basic concepts about a PostGIS cluster"},{"location":"postgis/#create-a-new-postgresql-cluster-with-postgis","text":"Let's suppose you want to create a new PostgreSQL 17 cluster with PostGIS 3.2. The first step is to ensure you use the right PostGIS container image for the operand, and properly set the .spec.imageName option in the Cluster resource.

Warning Please consider that, although convention over configuration applies in CloudNativePG, you should spend time configuring and tuning your system for production.

For instance, in version 17.1: 17 is the major version 1 is the minor version Minor releases are fully compatible with earlier and later minor releases of the same major version. They include bug fixes and security updates but do not introduce changes to the internal storage format. For example, PostgreSQL 17.1 is compatible with 17.0 and 17.4. Upgrading a Minor Version in CloudNativePG To upgrade to a newer minor version, simply update the PostgreSQL container image reference in your cluster definition, either directly or via image catalogs. CloudNativePG will trigger a rolling update of the cluster , replacing each instance one by one, starting with the replicas. Once all replicas have been updated, it will perform either a switchover or a restart of the primary to complete the process. Major Version Upgrades Major PostgreSQL releases introduce changes to the internal data storage format, requiring a more structured upgrade process. CloudNativePG supports three methods for performing major upgrades: Logical dump/restore \u2013 Blue/green deployment, offline. Native logical replication \u2013 Blue/green deployment, online. Physical with pg_upgrade \u2013 In-place upgrade, offline (covered in the \"Offline In-Place Major Upgrades\" section below). Each method has trade-offs in terms of downtime, complexity, and data volume handling. The best approach depends on your upgrade strategy and operational constraints. Important We strongly recommend testing all methods in a controlled environment before proceeding with a production upgrade. Offline In-Place Major Upgrades CloudNativePG performs an offline in-place major upgrade when a new operand container image with a higher PostgreSQL major version is declaratively requested for a cluster. You can trigger the upgrade in one of two ways: By updating the major version in the image tag via the .spec.imageName option. Using an image catalog to manage version changes. For details on supported image tags, see \"Image Tag Requirements\" . Warning CloudNativePG is not responsible for PostgreSQL extensions. You must ensure that extensions in the source PostgreSQL image are compatible with those in the target image and that upgrade paths are supported. Thoroughly test the upgrade process in advance to avoid unexpected issues. The extensions management feature can help manage extension upgrades declaratively. Upgrade Process Shuts down all cluster pods to ensure data consistency. Records the previous PostgreSQL version in the cluster\u2019s status under .status.majorVersionUpgradeFromImage . Initiates a new upgrade job, which: Verifies that the binaries in the image and the data files align with a major upgrade request. Creates new directories for PGDATA , and where applicable, WAL files and tablespaces. Performs the upgrade using pg_upgrade with the --link option. Upon successful completion, replaces the original directories with their upgraded counterparts. Warning During the upgrade process, the entire PostgreSQL cluster, including replicas, is unavailable to applications. Ensure that your system can tolerate this downtime before proceeding. Warning Performing an in-place upgrade is an exceptional operation that carries inherent risks. It is strongly recommended to take a full backup of the cluster before initiating the upgrade process. Info For detailed guidance on pg_upgrade , refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation . Post-Upgrade Actions If the upgrade is successful, CloudNativePG: Destroys the PVCs of replicas (if available). Scales up replicas as required. Warning Re-cloning replicas can be time-consuming, especially for very large databases. Plan accordingly to accommodate potential delays. After completing the upgrade, it is strongly recommended to take a full backup. Existing backup data (namely base backups and WAL files) is only available for the previous minor PostgreSQL release. Warning pg_upgrade doesn't transfer optimizer statistics. After the upgrade, you may want to run ANALYZE on your databases to update them. If the upgrade fails, you must manually revert the major version change in the cluster's configuration and delete the upgrade job, as CloudNativePG cannot automatically decide the rollback. Important This process protects your existing database from data loss , as no data is modified during the upgrade. If the upgrade fails, a rollback is usually possible, without having to perform a full recovery from a backup. Ensure you monitor the process closely and take corrective action if needed. Example: Performing a Major Upgrade Consider the following PostgreSQL cluster running version 16: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:16-minimal-bookworm instances: 3 storage: size: 1Gi You can check the current PostgreSQL version using the following command: kubectl cnpg psql cluster-example -- -qAt -c 'SELECT version()' This will return output similar to: PostgreSQL 16.x ...

Configuration is possible through the postgresql section of the Cluster resource definition by defining custom postgresql.conf , pg_hba.conf , and pg_ident.conf settings via the parameters , the pg_hba , and the pg_ident keys. These settings are the same across all instances. Warning Please don't use the ALTER SYSTEM query to change the configuration of the PostgreSQL instances in an imperative way. Changing some of the options that are normally controlled by the operator might indeed lead to an unpredictable/unrecoverable state of the cluster. Moreover, ALTER SYSTEM changes are not replicated across the cluster. See \"Enabling ALTER SYSTEM\" below for details. A reference for custom settings usage is included in the samples, see cluster-example-custom.yaml . The postgresql section The PostgreSQL instance in the pod starts with a default postgresql.conf file, to which these settings are automatically added: listen_addresses = '*' include custom.conf The custom.conf file will contain the user-defined settings in the postgresql section, as in the following example: # ... postgresql: parameters: shared_buffers: \"1GB\" # ... PostgreSQL GUCs: Grand Unified Configuration Refer to the PostgreSQL documentation for more information on the available parameters , also known as GUC (Grand Unified Configuration). Please note that CloudNativePG accepts only strings for the PostgreSQL parameters. The content of custom.conf is automatically generated and maintained by the operator by applying the following sections in this order: Global default parameters Default parameters that depend on the PostgreSQL major version User-provided parameters Fixed parameters The global default parameters are: archive_mode = 'on' dynamic_shared_memory_type = 'posix' full_page_writes = 'on' logging_collector = 'on' log_destination = 'csvlog' log_directory = '/controller/log' log_filename = 'postgres' log_rotation_age = '0' log_rotation_size = '0' log_truncate_on_rotation = 'false' max_parallel_workers = '32' max_replication_slots = '32' max_worker_processes = '32' shared_memory_type = 'mmap' # for PostgreSQL >= 12 only wal_keep_size = '512MB' # for PostgreSQL >= 13 only wal_keep_segments = '32' # for PostgreSQL <= 12 only wal_level = 'logical' wal_log_hints = 'on' wal_sender_timeout = '5s' wal_receiver_timeout = '5s' Warning It is your duty to plan for WAL segments retention in your PostgreSQL cluster and properly configure either wal_keep_size or wal_keep_segments , depending on the server version, based on the expected and observed workloads. Alternatively, if the only streaming replication clients are the replica instances running in the High Availability cluster, you can take advantage of the replication slots feature, which adds support for replication slots at the cluster level. You can enable the feature with the replicationSlots.highAvailability option (for more information, please refer to the \"Replication\" section .) Without replication slots nor continuous backups in place, configuring wal_keep_size or wal_keep_segments is the only way to protect standbys from falling out of sync. If a standby did fall out of sync it would produce error messages like: \"could not receive data from WAL stream: ERROR: requested WAL segment ************************ has already been removed\" . This will require you to dedicate a part of your PGDATA , or the volume dedicated to storing WAL files, to keep older WAL segments for streaming replication purposes. The following parameters are fixed and exclusively controlled by the operator: archive_command = '/controller/manager wal-archive %p' hot_standby = 'true' listen_addresses = '*' port = '5432' restart_after_crash = 'false' ssl = 'on' ssl_ca_file = '/controller/certificates/client-ca.crt' ssl_cert_file = '/controller/certificates/server.crt' ssl_key_file = '/controller/certificates/server.key' unix_socket_directories = '/controller/run' Since the fixed parameters are added at the end, they can't be overridden by the user via the YAML configuration. Those parameters are required for correct WAL archiving and replication. Replication Settings The primary_conninfo , restore_command , and recovery_target_timeline parameters are automatically managed by the operator based on the instance's role within the cluster. These parameters are effectively applied only when the instance is operating as a replica. primary_conninfo = 'host=<PRIMARY> user=postgres dbname=postgres' recovery_target_timeline = 'latest' The STANDBY_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT operator configuration setting , if specified, sets the tcp_user_timeout parameter on all standby instances managed by the operator. The tcp_user_timeout parameter determines how long transmitted data can remain unacknowledged before the TCP connection is forcibly closed. Adjusting this value allows you to fine-tune the responsiveness of standby instances to network disruptions. For more details, refer to the PostgreSQL documentation . Log control settings The operator requires PostgreSQL to output its log in CSV format, and the instance manager automatically parses it and outputs it in JSON format. For this reason, all log settings in PostgreSQL are fixed and cannot be changed. For further information, please refer to the \"Logging\" section . Shared Preload Libraries The shared_preload_libraries option in PostgreSQL exists to specify one or more shared libraries to be pre-loaded at server start, in the form of a comma-separated list. Typically, it is used in PostgreSQL to load those extensions that need to be available to most database sessions in the whole system (e.g. pg_stat_statements ). In CloudNativePG the shared_preload_libraries option is empty by default. Although you can override the content of shared_preload_libraries , we recommend that only expert Postgres users take advantage of this option. Important In case a specified library is not found, the server fails to start, preventing CloudNativePG from any self-healing attempt and requiring manual intervention. Please make sure you always test both the extensions and the settings of shared_preload_libraries if you plan to directly manage its content. CloudNativePG is able to automatically manage the content of the shared_preload_libraries option for some of the most used PostgreSQL extensions (see the \"Managed extensions\" section below for details). Specifically, as soon as the operator notices that a configuration parameter requires one of the managed libraries, it will automatically add the needed library. The operator will also remove the library as soon as no actual parameter requires it. Important Please always keep in mind that removing libraries from shared_preload_libraries requires a restart of all instances in the cluster in order to be effective. You can provide additional shared_preload_libraries via .spec.postgresql.shared_preload_libraries as a list of strings: the operator will merge them with the ones that it automatically manages. Managed extensions As anticipated in the previous section, CloudNativePG automatically manages the content in shared_preload_libraries for some well-known and supported extensions. The current list includes: auto_explain pg_stat_statements pgaudit pg_failover_slots Some of these libraries also require additional objects in a database before using them, normally views and/or functions managed via the CREATE EXTENSION command to be run in a database (the DROP EXTENSION command typically removes those objects). For such libraries, CloudNativePG automatically handles the creation and removal of the extension in all databases that accept a connection in the cluster, identified by the following query: SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datallowconn Note The above query also includes template databases like template1 . Important With the introduction of declarative extensions in the Database CRD, you can now manage extensions directly. As a result, the managed extensions feature may undergo significant changes in future versions of CloudNativePG, and some functionalities might be deprecated. Enabling auto_explain The auto_explain extension provides a means for logging execution plans of slow statements automatically, without having to manually run EXPLAIN (helpful for tracking down un-optimized queries). You can enable auto_explain by adding to the configuration a parameter that starts with auto_explain. as in the following example excerpt (which automatically logs execution plans of queries that take longer than 10 seconds to complete): # ... postgresql: parameters: auto_explain.log_min_duration: \"10s\" # ... Note Enabling auto_explain can lead to performance issues. Please refer to the auto explain documentation Enabling pg_stat_statements The pg_stat_statements extension is one of the most important capabilities available in PostgreSQL for real-time monitoring of queries. You can enable pg_stat_statements by adding to the configuration a parameter that starts with pg_stat_statements. as in the following example excerpt: # ... postgresql: parameters: pg_stat_statements.max: \"10000\" pg_stat_statements.track: all # ... As explained previously, the operator will automatically add pg_stat_statements to shared_preload_libraries and run CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements on each database, enabling you to run queries against the pg_stat_statements view. Enabling pgaudit The pgaudit extension provides detailed session and/or object audit logging via the standard PostgreSQL logging facility. CloudNativePG has transparent and native support for PGAudit on PostgreSQL clusters. For further information, please refer to the \"PGAudit\" logs section. You can enable pgaudit by adding to the configuration a parameter that starts with pgaudit. as in the following example excerpt: # postgresql: parameters: pgaudit.log: \"all, -misc\" pgaudit.log_catalog: \"off\" pgaudit.log_parameter: \"on\" pgaudit.log_relation: \"on\" # Enabling pg_failover_slots The pg_failover_slots extension by EDB ensures that logical replication slots can survive a failover scenario. Failovers are normally implemented using physical streaming replication, like in the case of CloudNativePG. You can enable pg_failover_slots by adding to the configuration a parameter that starts with pg_failover_slots. : as explained above, the operator will transparently manage the pg_failover_slots entry in the shared_preload_libraries option depending on this. Please refer to the pg_failover_slots documentation for details on this extension. Additionally, for each database that you intend to you use with pg_failover_slots you need to add an entry in the pg_hba section that enables each replica to connect to the primary. For example, suppose that you want to use the app database with pg_failover_slots , you need to add this entry in the pg_hba section: postgresql: pg_hba: - hostssl app streaming_replica all cert The pg_hba section pg_hba is a list of PostgreSQL Host Based Authentication rules used to create the pg_hba.conf used by the pods. Important See the PostgreSQL documentation for more information on pg_hba.conf . Since the first matching rule is used for authentication, the pg_hba.conf file generated by the operator can be seen as composed of four sections: Fixed rules User-defined rules Optional LDAP section Default rules Fixed rules: local all all peer hostssl postgres streaming_replica all cert hostssl replication streaming_replica all cert hostssl all cnpg_pooler_pgbouncer all cert Default rules: host all all all <default-authentication-method> From PostgreSQL 14 the default value of the password_encryption database parameter is set to scram-sha-256 . Because of that, the default authentication method is scram-sha-256 from this PostgreSQL version. PostgreSQL 13 and older will use md5 as the default authentication method. The resulting pg_hba.conf will look like this: local all all peer hostssl postgres streaming_replica all cert hostssl replication streaming_replica all cert <user defined rules> <user defined LDAP> host all all all scram-sha-256 # (or md5 for PostgreSQL version <= 13) Inside the cluster manifest, pg_hba lines are added as list items in .spec.postgresql.pg_hba , as in the following excerpt: postgresql: pg_hba: - hostssl app app 10.244.0.0/16 md5 In the above example we are enabling access for the app user to the app database using MD5 password authentication (you can use scram-sha-256 if you prefer) via a secure channel ( hostssl ). LDAP Configuration Under the postgres section of the cluster spec there is an optional ldap section available to define an LDAP configuration to be converted into a rule added into the pg_hba.conf file. This will support two modes: simple bind mode which requires specifying a server , prefix and suffix in the LDAP section and the search+bind mode which requires specifying server , baseDN , binDN , and a bindPassword which is a secret containing the ldap password. Additionally, in search+bind mode you have the option to specify a searchFilter or searchAttribute . If no searchAttribute is specified the default one of uid will be used. Additionally, both modes allow the specification of a scheme for ldapscheme and a port . Neither scheme nor port are required, however. This section filled out for search+bind could look as follows: postgresql: ldap: server: 'openldap.default.svc.cluster.local' bindSearchAuth: baseDN: 'ou=org,dc=example,dc=com' bindDN: 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com' bindPassword: name: 'ldapBindPassword' key: 'data' searchAttribute: 'uid' The pg_ident section pg_ident is a list of PostgreSQL User Name Maps that CloudNativePG uses to generate and maintain the ident map file (known as pg_ident.conf ) inside the data directory. Important See the PostgreSQL documentation for more information on pg_ident.conf . The pg_ident.conf file written by the operator is made up of the following two sections: Fixed rules User-defined rules Currently the only fixed rule, automatically generated by the operator, is: local <postgres system user> postgres The instance manager detects the user running the PostgreSQL instance and automatically adds a rule to map it to the postgres user in the database. If the postgres user is not properly configured inside the container, the instance manager will allow any local user to connect and then log a warning message like the following: Unable to identify the current user. Falling back to insecure mapping. The resulting pg_ident.conf will look like this: local <postgres system user> postgres <user defined lines> Inside the cluster manifest, pg_ident lines are added as list items in .spec.postgresql.pg_ident . For example: postgresql: pg_ident: - \"mymap /^(.*)@mydomain\\\\.com$ \\\\1\" Changing configuration You can apply configuration changes by editing the postgresql section of the Cluster resource. After the change, the cluster instances will immediately reload the configuration to apply the changes. If the change involves a parameter requiring a restart, the operator will perform a rolling upgrade. Enabling ALTER SYSTEM CloudNativePG strongly advocates employing the Cluster manifest as the exclusive method for altering the configuration of a PostgreSQL cluster. This approach guarantees coherence across the entire high-availability cluster and aligns with best practices for Infrastructure-as-Code. In CloudNativePG the default configuration disables the use of ALTER SYSTEM on new Postgres clusters. This decision is rooted in the recognition of potential risks associated with this command. To enable the use of ALTER SYSTEM , you can explicitly set .spec.postgresql.enableAlterSystem to true . Warning Proceed with caution when utilizing ALTER SYSTEM . This command operates directly on the connected instance and does not undergo replication. CloudNativePG assumes responsibility for certain fixed parameters and complete control over others, emphasizing the need for careful consideration. Starting from PostgreSQL 17, the .spec.postgresql.enableAlterSystem setting directly controls the allow_alter_system GUC in PostgreSQL \u2014 a feature directly contributed by CloudNativePG to PostgreSQL. Prior to PostgreSQL 17, when .spec.postgresql.enableAlterSystem is set to false , the postgresql.auto.conf file is made read-only. Consequently, any attempt to execute the ALTER SYSTEM command will result in an error. The error message might look like this: ERROR: could not open file \"postgresql.auto.conf\": Permission denied Dynamic Shared Memory settings PostgreSQL supports a few implementations for dynamic shared memory management through the dynamic_shared_memory_type configuration option. In CloudNativePG we recommend to limit ourselves to any of the following two values: posix : which relies on POSIX shared memory allocated using shm_open (default setting) sysv : which is based on System V shared memory allocated via shmget In PostgreSQL, this setting is particularly important for memory allocation in parallel queries. For details, please refer to this thread from the pgsql-general mailing list . POSIX shared memory The default setting of posix should be enough in most cases, considering that the operator automatically mounts a memory-bound EmptyDir volume called shm under /dev/shm . You can verify the size of such volume inside the running Postgres container with: mount | grep shm You should get something similar to the following output: shm on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=******) If you would like to set a maximum size for the shm volume, you can do so by setting the .spec.ephemeralVolumesSizeLimit.shm field in the Cluster resource. For example: spec: ephemeralVolumesSizeLimit: shm: 1Gi System V shared memory In case your Kubernetes cluster has a high enough value for the SHMMAX and SHMALL parameters, you can also set: dynamic_shared_memory_type: \"sysv\" You can check the SHMMAX / SHMALL from inside a PostgreSQL container, by running: ipcs -lm For example: ------ Shared Memory Limits -------- max number of segments = 4096 max seg size (kbytes) = 18014398509465599 max total shared memory (kbytes) = 18014398509481980 min seg size (bytes) = 1 As you can see, the very high number of max total shared memory recommends setting dynamic_shared_memory_type to sysv . An alternate method is to run: cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmall cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax Fixed parameters Some PostgreSQL configuration parameters should be managed exclusively by the operator. The operator prevents the user from setting them using a webhook.

Alternatively, if the only streaming replication clients are the replica instances running in the High Availability cluster, you can take advantage of the replication slots feature, which adds support for replication slots at the cluster level. You can enable the feature with the replicationSlots.highAvailability option (for more information, please refer to the \"Replication\" section .) Without replication slots nor continuous backups in place, configuring wal_keep_size or wal_keep_segments is the only way to protect standbys from falling out of sync. If a standby did fall out of sync it would produce error messages like: \"could not receive data from WAL stream: ERROR: requested WAL segment ************************ has already been removed\" . This will require you to dedicate a part of your PGDATA , or the volume dedicated to storing WAL files, to keep older WAL segments for streaming replication purposes.

Warning The instructions contained in this section are for demonstration, testing, and practice purposes only and must not be used in production. Like any other Kubernetes application, CloudNativePG is deployed using regular manifests written in YAML. By following the instructions on this page you should be able to start a PostgreSQL cluster on your local Kubernetes installation and experiment with it. Important Make sure that you have kubectl installed on your machine in order to connect to the Kubernetes cluster. Please follow the Kubernetes documentation on how to install kubectl . Part 1: Setup the local Kubernetes playground The first part is about installing Minikube or Kind. Please spend some time reading about the systems and decide which one to proceed with. After setting up one of them, please proceed with part 2. We also provide instructions for setting up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana for local testing/evaluation, in part 4 Minikube Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day. Normally, it is used in conjunction with VirtualBox. You can find more information in the official Kubernetes documentation on how to install Minikube in your local personal environment. When you installed it, run the following command to create a minikube cluster: minikube start This will create the Kubernetes cluster, and you will be ready to use it. Verify that it works with the following command: kubectl get nodes You will see one node called minikube . Kind If you do not want to use a virtual machine hypervisor, then Kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container \"nodes\" (Kind stands for \"Kubernetes IN Docker\" indeed). Install kind on your environment following the instructions in the Quickstart , then create a Kubernetes cluster with: kind create cluster --name pg Part 2: Install CloudNativePG Now that you have a Kubernetes installation up and running on your laptop, you can proceed with CloudNativePG installation. Please refer to the \"Installation\" section and then proceed with the deployment of a PostgreSQL cluster. Part 3: Deploy a PostgreSQL cluster As with any other deployment in Kubernetes, to deploy a PostgreSQL cluster you need to apply a configuration file that defines your desired Cluster . The cluster-example.yaml sample file defines a simple Cluster using the default storage class to allocate disk space: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 storage: size: 1Gi There's more For more detailed information about the available options, please refer to the \"API Reference\" section . In order to create the 3-node PostgreSQL cluster, you need to run the following command: kubectl apply -f cluster-example.yaml You can check that the pods are being created with the get pods command: kubectl get pods That will look for pods in the default namespace. To separate your cluster from other workloads on your Kubernetes installation, you could always create a new namespace to deploy clusters on. Alternatively, you can use labels. The operator will apply the cnpg.io/cluster label on all objects relevant to a particular cluster. For example: kubectl get pods -l cnpg.io/cluster=<CLUSTER> Important Note that we are using cnpg.io/cluster as the label. In the past you may have seen or used postgresql . This label is being deprecated, and will be dropped in the future. Please use cnpg.io/cluster . By default, the operator will install the latest available minor version of the latest major version of PostgreSQL when the operator was released. You can override this by setting the imageName key in the spec section of the Cluster definition. For example, to install PostgreSQL 13.6: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: # [...] spec: # [...] imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:13.6 #[...] Important The immutable infrastructure paradigm requires that you always point to a specific version of the container image. Never use tags like latest or 13 in a production environment as it might lead to unpredictable scenarios in terms of update policies and version consistency in the cluster. For strict deterministic and repeatable deployments, you can add the digests to the image name, through the <image>:<tag>@sha256:<digestValue> format. There's more There are some examples cluster configurations bundled with the operator. Please refer to the \"Examples\" section . Part 4: Monitor clusters with Prometheus and Grafana Important Installing Prometheus and Grafana is beyond the scope of this project. The instructions in this section are provided for experimentation and illustration only. In this section we show how to deploy Prometheus and Grafana for observability, and how to create a Grafana Dashboard to monitor CloudNativePG clusters, and a set of Prometheus Rules defining alert conditions. We leverage the Kube-Prometheus stack , Helm chart, which is maintained by the Prometheus Community . Please refer to the project website for additional documentation and background. The Kube-Prometheus-stack Helm chart installs the Prometheus Operator , including the Alert Manager , and a Grafana deployment. We include a configuration file for the deployment of this Helm chart that will provide useful initial settings for observability of CloudNativePG clusters. Installation If you don't have Helm installed yet, please follow the instructions to install it in your system. We need to add the prometheus-community helm chart repository, and then install the Kube Prometheus stack using the sample configuration we provide: We can accomplish this with the following commands: helm repo add prometheus-community \\ https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts helm upgrade --install \\ -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/main/docs/src/samples/monitoring/kube-stack-config.yaml \\ prometheus-community \\ prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack After completion, you will have Prometheus, Grafana and Alert Manager installed with values from the kube-stack-config.yaml file: From the Prometheus installation, you will have the Prometheus Operator watching for any PodMonitor (see monitoring ). The Grafana installation will be watching for a Grafana dashboard ConfigMap . Seealso For further information about the above command, refer to the helm install documentation. You can see several Custom Resources have been created: % kubectl get crds NAME CREATED AT \u2026 alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com <timestamp> \u2026 prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com <timestamp> prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com <timestamp> \u2026 as well as a series of Services: % kubectl get svc NAME TYPE PORT(S) \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 prometheus-community-grafana ClusterIP 80/TCP prometheus-community-kube-alertmanager ClusterIP 9093/TCP prometheus-community-kube-operator ClusterIP 443/TCP prometheus-community-kube-prometheus ClusterIP 9090/TCP Viewing with Prometheus At this point, a CloudNativePG cluster deployed with Monitoring activated would be observable via Prometheus.

In PostgreSQL terminology, recovery is the process of starting a PostgreSQL instance using an existing backup. The PostgreSQL recovery mechanism is very solid and rich. It also supports point-in-time recovery (PITR), which allows you to restore a given cluster up to any point in time, from the first available backup in your catalog to the last archived WAL. (The WAL archive is mandatory in this case.) In CloudNativePG, you can't perform recovery in place on an existing cluster. Recovery is instead a way to bootstrap a new Postgres cluster starting from an available physical backup. Note For details on the bootstrap stanza, see Bootstrap . The recovery bootstrap mode lets you create a cluster from an existing physical base backup. You then reapply the WAL files containing the REDO log from the archive. WAL files are pulled from the defined recovery object store . Base backups can be taken either on object stores or using volume snapshots. Info Starting with version 1.25, CloudNativePG includes experimental support for backup and recovery using plugins, such as the Barman Cloud plugin . You can achieve recovery from a recovery object store in two ways: We recommend using a recovery object store, that is, a backup of another cluster created by Barman Cloud and defined by way of the barmanObjectStore option in the externalClusters section. Alternatively, you can use an existing Backup object in the same namespace. Both recovery methods enable either full recovery (up to the last available WAL) or up to a point in time . When performing a full recovery, you can also start the cluster in replica mode (see replica clusters for reference). Important If using replica mode, make sure that the PostgreSQL configuration ( .spec.postgresql.parameters ) of the recovered cluster is compatible with the original one from a physical replication standpoint. For recovery using volume snapshots : Use a consistent set of VolumeSnapshot objects that all belong to the same backup and are identified by the same cnpg.io/cluster and cnpg.io/backupName labels. Then, recover through the volumeSnapshots option in the .spec.bootstrap.recovery stanza, as described in Recovery from VolumeSnapshot objects . Recovery from an object store You can recover from a backup created by Barman Cloud and stored on a supported object store. After you define the external cluster, including all the required configuration in the barmanObjectStore section, you need to reference it in the .spec.recovery.source option. This example defines a recovery object store in a blob container in Azure: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-restore spec: [...] superuserSecret: name: superuser-secret bootstrap: recovery: source: clusterBackup externalClusters: - name: clusterBackup barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: https://STORAGEACCOUNTNAME.blob.core.windows.net/CONTAINERNAME/ azureCredentials: storageAccount: name: recovery-object-store-secret key: storage_account_name storageKey: name: recovery-object-store-secret key: storage_account_key wal: maxParallel: 8 The previous example assumes that the application database and its owning user are named app by default. If the PostgreSQL cluster being restored uses different names, you must specify these names before exiting the recovery phase, as documented in \"Configure the application database\" . Important By default, the recovery method strictly uses the name of the cluster in the externalClusters section as the name of the main folder of the backup data within the object store. This name is normally reserved for the name of the server. You can specify a different folder name using the barmanObjectStore.serverName property. Note This example takes advantage of the parallel WAL restore feature, dedicating up to 8 jobs to concurrently fetch the required WAL files from the archive. This feature can appreciably reduce the recovery time. Make sure that you plan ahead for this scenario and correctly tune the value of this parameter for your environment. It will make a difference when you need it, and you will. Recovery from VolumeSnapshot objects Warning When creating replicas after recovering the primary instance from the volume snapshot, the operator might end up using pg_basebackup to synchronize them. This behavior results in a slower process, depending on the size of the database. This limitation will be lifted in the future when support for online backups and PVC cloning are introduced. CloudNativePG can create a new cluster from a VolumeSnapshot of a PVC of an existing Cluster that's been taken using the declarative API for volume snapshot backups . You must specify the name of the snapshot, as in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-restore spec: [...] bootstrap: recovery: volumeSnapshots: storage: name: <snapshot name> kind: VolumeSnapshot apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io In case the backed-up cluster was using a separate PVC to store the WAL files, the recovery must include that too: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-restore spec: [...] bootstrap: recovery: volumeSnapshots: storage: name: <snapshot name> kind: VolumeSnapshot apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io walStorage: name: <snapshot name> kind: VolumeSnapshot apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io The previous example assumes that the application database and its owning user are named app by default. If the PostgreSQL cluster being restored uses different names, you must specify these names before exiting the recovery phase, as documented in \"Configure the application database\" . Warning If bootstrapping a replica-mode cluster from snapshots, to leverage snapshots for the standby instances and not just the primary, we recommend that you: Start with a single instance replica cluster. The primary instance will be recovered using the snapshot, and available WALs from the source cluster. Take a snapshot of the primary in the replica cluster. Increase the number of instances in the replica cluster as desired. Recovery from a Backup object If a Backup resource is already available in the namespace in which you need to create the cluster, you can specify the name using .spec.bootstrap.recovery.backup.name , as in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example-initdb spec: instances: 3 bootstrap: recovery: backup: name: backup-example storage: size: 1Gi This bootstrap method allows you to specify just a reference to the backup that needs to be restored. The previous example assumes that the application database and its owning user are named app by default. If the PostgreSQL cluster being restored uses different names, you must specify these names before exiting the recovery phase, as documented in \"Configure the application database\" . Additional Considerations Whether you recover from an object store, a volume snapshot, or an existing Backup resource, no changes to the database, including the catalog, are permitted until the Cluster is fully promoted to primary and accepts write operations. This restriction includes any role overrides, which are deferred until the Cluster transitions to primary. As a result, the following considerations apply: The application database name and user are copied from the backup being restored. The operator does not currently back up the underlying secrets, as this is part of the usual maintenance activity of the Kubernetes cluster. To preserve the original postgres user password, configure enableSuperuserAccess and supply a superuserSecret . By default, recovery continues up to the latest available WAL on the default target timeline ( latest ). You can optionally specify a recoveryTarget to perform a point-in-time recovery (see Point in Time Recovery (PITR) ). Important Consider using the barmanObjectStore.wal.maxParallel option to speed up WAL fetching from the archive by concurrently downloading the transaction logs from the recovery object store. Point in time recovery (PITR) Instead of replaying all the WALs up to the latest one, after extracting a base backup, you can ask PostgreSQL to stop replaying WALs at any given point in time. PostgreSQL uses this technique to achieve PITR. The presence of a WAL archive is mandatory. Important PITR requires you to specify a recovery target by using the options described in Recovery targets . The operator generates the configuration parameters required for this feature to work if you specify a recovery target. PITR from an object store This example uses a recovery object store in Azure that contains both the base backups and the WAL archive. The recovery target is based on a requested timestamp. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-restore-pitr spec: instances: 3 storage: size: 5Gi bootstrap: recovery: # Recovery object store containing WAL archive and base backups source: clusterBackup recoveryTarget: # Time base target for the recovery targetTime: \"2023-08-11 11:14:21.00000+02\" externalClusters: - name: clusterBackup barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: https://STORAGEACCOUNTNAME.blob.core.windows.net/CONTAINERNAME/ azureCredentials: storageAccount: name: recovery-object-store-secret key: storage_account_name storageKey: name: recovery-object-store-secret key: storage_account_key wal: maxParallel: 8 In this example, you had to specify only the targetTime in the form of a timestamp. You didn't have to specify the base backup from which to start the recovery. The backupID option is the one that allows you to specify the base backup from which to initiate the recovery process. By default, this value is empty. If you assign a value to it (in the form of a Barman backup ID), the operator uses that backup as the base for the recovery. Important You need to make sure that such a backup exists and is accessible. If you don't specify the backup ID, the operator detects the base backup for the recovery as follows: When you use targetTime or targetLSN , the operator selects the closest backup that was completed before that target. Otherwise, the operator selects the last available backup, in chronological order. PITR from VolumeSnapshot objects The example that follows uses: A Kubernetes volume snapshot for the PGDATA containing the base backup from which to start the recovery process. This snapshot is identified in the recovery.volumeSnapshots section and called test-snapshot-1 . A recovery object store in MinIO containing the WAL archive. The object store is identified by the recovery.source option in the form of an external cluster definition. The recovery target is based on a requested timestamp. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example-snapshot spec: # ... bootstrap: recovery: source: cluster-example-with-backup volumeSnapshots: storage: name: test-snapshot-1 kind: VolumeSnapshot apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io recoveryTarget: targetTime: \"2023-07-06T08:00:39\" externalClusters: - name: cluster-example-with-backup barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://backups/ endpointURL: http://minio:9000 s3Credentials: accessKeyId: name: minio key: ACCESS_KEY_ID secretAccessKey: name: minio key: ACCESS_SECRET_KEY Note If the backed-up cluster had walStorage enabled, you also must specify the volume snapshot containing the PGWAL directory, as mentioned in Recovery from VolumeSnapshot objects . Warning It's your responsibility to ensure that the end time of the base backup in the volume snapshot is before the recovery target timestamp. Recovery targets Here are the recovery target criteria you can use: targetTime Time stamp up to which recovery proceeds, expressed in RFC 3339 format. (The precise stopping point is also influenced by the exclusive option.) targetXID Transaction ID up to which recovery proceeds. (The precise stopping point is also influenced by the exclusive option.) Keep in mind that while transaction IDs are assigned sequentially at transaction start, transactions can complete in a different numeric order. The transactions that are recovered are those that committed before (and optionally including) the specified one. targetName Named restore point (created with pg_create_restore_point() ) to which recovery proceeds. targetLSN LSN of the write-ahead log location up to which recovery proceeds. (The precise stopping point is also influenced by the exclusive option.) targetImmediate Recovery ends as soon as a consistent state is reached, that is, as early as possible. When restoring from an online backup, this means the point where taking the backup ended. Important The operator can retrieve the closest backup when you specify either targetTime or targetLSN . However, this isn't possible for the remaining targets: targetName , targetXID , and targetImmediate . In such cases, it's mandatory to specify backupID . This example uses a targetName -based recovery target: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] bootstrap: recovery: source: clusterBackup recoveryTarget: backupID: 20220616T142236 targetName: 'restore_point_1' [...] You can choose only a single one among the targets in each recoveryTarget configuration. Additionally, you can specify targetTLI to force recovery to a specific timeline. By default, the previous parameters are considered to be inclusive, stopping just after the recovery target, matching the behavior in PostgreSQL . You can request exclusive behavior, stopping right before the recovery target, by setting the exclusive parameter to true . The following example shows this behavior, relying on a blob container in Azure for both base backups and the WAL archive: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-restore-pitr spec: instances: 3 storage: size: 5Gi bootstrap: recovery: source: clusterBackup recoveryTarget: backupID: 20220616T142236 targetName: \"maintenance-activity\" exclusive: true externalClusters: - name: clusterBackup barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: https://STORAGEACCOUNTNAME.blob.core.windows.net/CONTAINERNAME/ azureCredentials: storageAccount: name: recovery-object-store-secret key: storage_account_name storageKey: name: recovery-object-store-secret key: storage_account_key wal: maxParallel: 8 Configure the application database For the recovered cluster, you can configure the application database name and credentials with additional configuration. To update application database credentials, you can generate your own passwords, store them as secrets, and update the database to use the secrets. Or you can also let the operator generate a secret with a randomly secure password for use. See Bootstrap an empty cluster for more information about secrets. Important While the Cluster is in recovery mode, no changes to the database, including the catalog, are permitted. This restriction includes any role overrides, which are deferred until the Cluster transitions to primary. During this phase, users remain as defined in the source cluster. The following example configures the app database with the owner app and the password stored in the provided secret app-secret , following the bootstrap from a live cluster. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: bootstrap: recovery: database: app owner: app secret: name: app-secret [...] With the above configuration, the following will happen only after recovery is completed : If the app database does not exist, it will be created. If the app user does not exist, it will be created. If the app user is not the owner of the app database, ownership will be granted to the app user. If the username value matches the owner value in the secret, the password for the application user (the app user in this case) will be updated to the password value in the secret. How recovery works under the hood You can use the data uploaded to the object storage to bootstrap a new cluster from an existing backup. The operator orchestrates the recovery process using the barman-cloud-restore tool (for the base backup) and the barman-cloud-wal-restore tool (for WAL files, including parallel support, if requested). For details and instructions on the recovery bootstrap method, see Bootstrap from a backup . Important If you're not familiar with how PostgreSQL PITR works, we suggest that you configure the recovery cluster as the original one when it comes to .spec.postgresql.parameters . Once the new cluster is restored, you can then change the settings as desired. The way it works is that the operator injects an init container in the first instance of the new cluster, and the init container starts recovering the backup from the object storage. Important The duration of the base backup copy in the new PVC depends on the size of the backup, as well as the speed of both the network and the storage. When the base backup recovery process is complete, the operator starts the Postgres instance in recovery mode. In this phase, PostgreSQL is up, though not able to accept connections, and the pod is healthy according to the liveness probe. By way of the restore_command , PostgreSQL starts fetching WAL files from the archive. (You can speed up this phase by setting the maxParallel option and enabling the parallel WAL restore capability.) This phase terminates when PostgreSQL reaches the target (either the end of the WAL or the required target in case of PITR. You can optionally specify a recoveryTarget to perform a PITR. If left unspecified, the recovery continues up to the latest available WAL on the default target timeline ( latest ). Once the recovery is complete, the operator sets the required superuser password into the instance. The new primary instance starts as usual, and the remaining instances join the cluster as replicas. The process is transparent for the user and is managed by the instance manager running in the pods. Restoring into a cluster with a backup section A manifest for a cluster restore might include a backup section. This means that,after recovery, the new cluster starts archiving WALs and taking backups if configured to do so. For example, this section is part of a manifest for a cluster bootstrapping from the cluster cluster-example-backup . In the storage bucket, it creates a folder named recoveredCluster , where the base backups and WALs of the recovered cluster are stored. backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://backups/ endpointURL: http://minio:9000 serverName: \"recoveredCluster\" s3Credentials: accessKeyId: name: minio key: ACCESS_KEY_ID secretAccessKey: name: minio key: ACCESS_SECRET_KEY retentionPolicy: \"30d\" externalClusters: - name: cluster-example-backup barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://backups/ endpointURL: http://minio:9000 s3Credentials: Don't reuse the same barmanObjectStore configuration for different clusters. There might be cases where the existing information in the storage buckets could be overwritten by the new cluster. Warning The operator includes a safety check to ensure a cluster doesn't overwrite a storage bucket that contained information. A cluster that would overwrite existing storage remains in the state Setting up primary with pods in an error state. The pod logs show: ERROR: WAL archive check failed for server recoveredCluster: Expected empty archive . Important If you set the cnpg.io/skipEmptyWalArchiveCheck annotation to enabled in the recovered cluster, you can skip the safety check. We don't recommend skipping the check because, for the general use case, the check works fine. Skip this check only if you're familiar with the PostgreSQL recovery system, as severe data loss can occur.","title":"Recovery"},{"location":"recovery/#recovery","text":"Warning With the deprecation of native Barman Cloud support in CloudNativePG in favor of the Barman Cloud Plugin, this page\u2014and the backup and recovery documentation\u2014may undergo changes before the official release of version 1.26.0.

Important If you're not familiar with how PostgreSQL PITR works, we suggest that you configure the recovery cluster as the original one when it comes to .spec.postgresql.parameters . Once the new cluster is restored, you can then change the settings as desired. The way it works is that the operator injects an init container in the first instance of the new cluster, and the init container starts recovering the backup from the object storage. Important The duration of the base backup copy in the new PVC depends on the size of the backup, as well as the speed of both the network and the storage. When the base backup recovery process is complete, the operator starts the Postgres instance in recovery mode. In this phase, PostgreSQL is up, though not able to accept connections, and the pod is healthy according to the liveness probe. By way of the restore_command , PostgreSQL starts fetching WAL files from the archive. (You can speed up this phase by setting the maxParallel option and enabling the parallel WAL restore capability.)

A replica cluster is a CloudNativePG Cluster resource designed to replicate data from another PostgreSQL instance, ideally also managed by CloudNativePG. Typically, a replica cluster is deployed in a different Kubernetes cluster in another region. These clusters can be configured to perform cascading replication and can rely on object stores for data replication from the source, as detailed further down. There are primarily two use cases for replica clusters: Disaster Recovery and High Availability : Enhance disaster recovery and, to some extent, high availability of a CloudNativePG cluster across different Kubernetes clusters, typically located in different regions. In CloudNativePG terms, this is known as a \"Distributed Topology\" . Read-Only Workloads : Create standalone replicas of a PostgreSQL cluster for purposes such as reporting or Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). These replicas are primarily for read-only workloads. In CloudNativePG terms, this is referred to as a \"Standalone Replica Cluster\" . For example, the diagram below \u2014 taken from the \"Architecture\" section \u2014 illustrates a distributed PostgreSQL topology spanning two Kubernetes clusters, with a symmetric replica cluster primarily serving disaster recovery purposes. Basic Concepts CloudNativePG builds on the PostgreSQL replication framework, allowing you to create and synchronize a PostgreSQL cluster from an existing source cluster using the replica cluster feature \u2014 described in this section. The source can be a primary cluster or another replica cluster (cascading replication). About PostgreSQL Roles A replica cluster operates in continuous recovery mode, meaning no changes to the database, including the catalog and global objects like roles or databases, are permitted. These changes are deferred until the Cluster transitions to primary. During this phase, global objects such as roles remain as defined in the source cluster. CloudNativePG applies any local redefinitions once the cluster is promoted. If you are not planning to promote the cluster (e.g., for read-only workloads) or if you intend to detach completely from the source cluster once the replica cluster is promoted, you don't need to take any action. This is normally the case of the \"Standalone Replica Cluster\" . If you are planning to promote the cluster at some point, CloudNativePG will manage the following roles and passwords when transitioning from replica cluster to primary: the application user the superuser (if you are using it) any role defined using the declarative interface If your intention is to seamlessly ensure that the above roles and passwords don't change, you need to define the necessary secrets for the above in each Cluster . This is normally the case of the \"Distributed Topology\" . Bootstrapping a Replica Cluster The first step is to bootstrap the replica cluster using one of the following methods: Streaming replication via pg_basebackup Recovery from a volume snapshot Recovery from a Barman Cloud backup in an object store For detailed instructions on cloning a PostgreSQL server using pg_basebackup (streaming) or recovery (volume snapshot or object store), refer to the \"Bootstrap\" section . Configuring Replication Once the base backup for the replica cluster is available, you need to define how changes will be replicated from the origin using PostgreSQL continuous recovery. There are three main options: Streaming Replication : Set up streaming replication between the replica cluster and the source. This method requires configuring network connections and implementing appropriate administrative and security measures to ensure seamless data transfer. WAL Archive : Use the WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) archive stored in an object store. WAL files are regularly transferred from the source cluster to the object store, from where the barman-cloud-wal-restore utility retrieves them for the replica cluster. Hybrid Approach : Combine both streaming replication and WAL archive methods. PostgreSQL can manage and switch between these two approaches as needed to ensure data consistency and availability. Defining an External Cluster When configuring the external cluster, you have the following options: barmanObjectStore section : Enables use of the WAL archive, with CloudNativePG automatically setting the restore_command in the designated primary instance. Allows bootstrapping the replica cluster from an object store using the recovery section if volume snapshots are not feasible. connectionParameters section : Enables bootstrapping the replica cluster via streaming replication using the pg_basebackup section. CloudNativePG automatically sets the primary_conninfo option in the designated primary instance, initiating a WAL receiver process to connect to the source cluster and receive data. Backup and Symmetric Architectures The replica cluster can perform backups to a reserved object store from the designated primary, supporting symmetric architectures in a distributed environment. This architectural choice is crucial as it ensures the cluster is prepared for promotion during a controlled data center switchover or a failover following an unexpected event. Distributed Architecture Flexibility You have the flexibility to design your preferred distributed architecture for a PostgreSQL database, choosing from: Private Cloud : Spanning multiple Kubernetes clusters in different data centers. Public Cloud : Spanning multiple Kubernetes clusters in different regions. Hybrid Cloud : Combining private and public clouds. Multi-Cloud : Spanning multiple Kubernetes clusters across different regions and Cloud Service Providers. Setting Up a Replica Cluster To set up a replica cluster from a source cluster, follow these steps to create a cluster YAML file and configure it accordingly: Define External Clusters : In the externalClusters section, specify the replica cluster. For a distributed PostgreSQL topology aimed at disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA), this section should be defined for every PostgreSQL cluster in the distributed database. Bootstrap the Replica Cluster : Streaming Bootstrap : Use the pg_basebackup section for bootstrapping via streaming replication. Snapshot/Object Store Bootstrap : Use the recovery section to bootstrap from a volume snapshot or an object store. Continuous Recovery Strategy : Define this in the .spec.replica stanza: Distributed Topology : Configure using the primary , source , and self fields along with the distributed topology defined in externalClusters . This allows CloudNativePG to declaratively control the demotion of a primary cluster and the subsequent promotion of a replica cluster using a promotion token. Standalone Replica Cluster : Enable continuous recovery using the enabled option and set the source field to point to an externalClusters name. This configuration is suitable for creating replicas primarily intended for read-only workloads. Both the Distributed Topology and the Standalone Replica Cluster strategies for continuous recovery are thoroughly explained below. Distributed Topology Important The Distributed Topology strategy was introduced in CloudNativePG 1.24. Planning for a Distributed PostgreSQL Database As Dwight Eisenhower famously said, \"Planning is everything\", and this holds true for designing PostgreSQL architectures in Kubernetes. First, conceptualize your distributed topology on paper, and then translate it into a CloudNativePG API configuration. This configuration primarily involves: The externalClusters section, which must be included in every Cluster definition within your distributed PostgreSQL setup. The .spec.replica stanza, specifically the primary , source , and (optionally) self fields. For example, suppose you want to deploy a PostgreSQL cluster distributed across two Kubernetes clusters located in Southern Europe and Central Europe. In this scenario, assume you have CloudNativePG installed in the Southern Europe Kubernetes cluster, with a PostgreSQL Cluster named cluster-eu-south acting as the primary. This cluster has continuous backup configured with a local object store. This object store is also accessible by the PostgreSQL Cluster named cluster-eu-central , installed in the Central European Kubernetes cluster. Initially, cluster-eu-central functions as a replica cluster. Following a symmetric approach, it also has a local object store for continuous backup, which needs to be read by cluster-eu-south . The recovery in this setup relies solely on WAL shipping, with no streaming connection between the two clusters. Here\u2019s how you would configure the externalClusters section for both Cluster resources: # Distributed topology configuration externalClusters: - name: cluster-eu-south barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://cluster-eu-south/ # Additional configuration - name: cluster-eu-central barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://cluster-eu-central/ # Additional configuration The .spec.replica stanza for the cluster-eu-south PostgreSQL primary Cluster should be configured as follows: replica: primary: cluster-eu-south source: cluster-eu-central Meanwhile, the .spec.replica stanza for the cluster-eu-central PostgreSQL replica Cluster should be configured as: replica: primary: cluster-eu-south source: cluster-eu-south In this configuration, when the primary field matches the name of the Cluster resource (or .spec.replica.self if a different one is used), the current cluster is considered the primary in the distributed topology. Otherwise, it is set as a replica from the source (in this case, using the Barman object store). This setup allows you to efficiently manage a distributed PostgreSQL architecture across multiple Kubernetes clusters, ensuring both high availability and disaster recovery through controlled switchover of a primary PostgreSQL cluster using declarative configuration. Controlled switchover in a distributed topology is a two-step process involving: Demotion of a primary cluster to a replica cluster Promotion of a replica cluster to a primary cluster These processes are described in the next sections. Important Before you proceed, ensure you review the \"About PostgreSQL Roles\" section above and use identical role definitions, including secrets, in all Cluster objects participating in the distributed topology. Demoting a Primary to a Replica Cluster CloudNativePG provides the functionality to demote a primary cluster to a replica cluster. This action is typically planned when transitioning the primary role from one data center to another. The process involves demoting the current primary cluster (e.g., cluster-eu-south ) to a replica cluster and subsequently promoting the designated replica cluster (e.g., cluster-eu-central ) to primary when fully synchronized. Provided you have defined an external cluster in the current primary Cluster resource that points to the replica cluster that's been selected to become the new primary, all you need to do is change the primary field as follows: replica: primary: cluster-eu-central source: cluster-eu-central When the primary PostgreSQL cluster is demoted, write operations are no longer possible. CloudNativePG then: Archives the WAL file containing the shutdown checkpoint as a .partial file in the WAL archive. Generates a demotionToken in the status, a base64-encoded JSON structure containing relevant information from pg_controldata such as the system identifier, the timestamp, timeline ID, REDO location, and REDO WAL file of the latest checkpoint. The first step is necessary to demote/promote using solely the WAL archive to feed the continuous recovery process (without streaming replication). The second step, generation of the .status.demotionToken , will ensure a smooth demotion/promotion process, without any data loss and without rebuilding the former primary. At this stage, the former primary has transitioned to a replica cluster, awaiting WAL data from the new global primary: cluster-eu-central . To proceed with promoting the other cluster, you need to retrieve the demotionToken from cluster-eu-south using the following command: kubectl get cluster cluster-eu-south \\ -o jsonpath='{.status.demotionToken}' You can obtain the demotionToken using the cnpg plugin by checking the cluster's status. The token is listed under the Demotion token section. Note The demotionToken obtained from cluster-eu-south will serve as the promotionToken for cluster-eu-central . You can verify the role change using the cnpg plugin, checking the status of the cluster: kubectl cnpg status cluster-eu-south Promoting a Replica to a Primary Cluster To promote a PostgreSQL replica cluster (e.g., cluster-eu-central ) to a primary cluster and make the designated primary an actual primary instance, you need to perform the following steps simultaneously: Set the .spec.replica.primary to the name of the current replica cluster to be promoted (e.g., cluster-eu-central ). Set the .spec.replica.promotionToken with the value obtained from the former primary cluster (refer to \"Demoting a Primary to a Replica Cluster\" ). The updated replica section in cluster-eu-central 's spec should look like this: replica: primary: cluster-eu-central promotionToken: <PROMOTION_TOKEN> source: cluster-eu-south Warning It is crucial to apply the changes to the primary and promotionToken fields simultaneously. If the promotion token is omitted, a failover will be triggered, necessitating a rebuild of the former primary. After making these adjustments, CloudNativePG will initiate the promotion of the replica cluster to a primary cluster. Initially, CloudNativePG will wait for the designated primary cluster to replicate all Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) information up to the specified Log Sequence Number (LSN) contained in the token. Once this target is achieved, the promotion process will commence. The new primary cluster will switch timelines, archive the history file and new WAL, thereby unblocking the replication process in the cluster-eu-south cluster, which will then operate as a replica. To verify the role change, use the cnpg plugin to check the status of the cluster: kubectl cnpg status cluster-eu-central This command will provide you with the current status of cluster-eu-central , confirming its promotion to primary. By following these steps, you ensure a smooth and controlled promotion process, minimizing disruption and maintaining data integrity across your PostgreSQL clusters. Standalone Replica Clusters Important Standalone Replica Clusters were previously known as Replica Clusters before the introduction of the Distributed Topology strategy in CloudNativePG 1.24. In CloudNativePG, a Standalone Replica Cluster is a PostgreSQL cluster in continuous recovery with the following configurations: .spec.replica.enabled set to true A physical replication source defined via the .spec.replica.source field, pointing to an externalClusters name When .spec.replica.enabled is set to false , the replica cluster exits continuous recovery mode and becomes a primary cluster, completely detached from the original source. Warning Disabling replication is an irreversible operation. Once replication is disabled and the designated primary is promoted to primary, the replica cluster and the source cluster become two independent clusters definitively. Important Standalone replica clusters are suitable for several use cases, primarily involving read-only workloads. If you are planning to setup a disaster recovery solution, look into \"Distributed Topology\" above. Main Differences with Distributed Topology Although Standalone Replica Clusters can be used for disaster recovery purposes, they differ from the \"Distributed Topology\" strategy in several key ways: Lack of Distributed Database Concept : Standalone Replica Clusters do not support the concept of a distributed database, whether in simple forms (two clusters) or more complex configurations (e.g., three clusters in a circular topology). No Global Primary Cluster : There is no notion of a global primary cluster in Standalone Replica Clusters. No Controlled Switchover : A Standalone Replica Cluster can only be promoted to primary. The former primary cluster must be re-cloned, as controlled switchover is not possible. Failover is identical in both strategies, requiring the former primary to be re-cloned if it ever comes back up. Example of Standalone Replica Cluster using pg_basebackup This first example defines a standalone replica cluster using streaming replication in both bootstrap and continuous recovery. The replica cluster connects to the source cluster using TLS authentication. You can check the sample YAML in the samples/ subdirectory. Note the bootstrap and replica sections pointing to the source cluster. bootstrap: pg_basebackup: source: cluster-example replica: enabled: true source: cluster-example The previous configuration assumes that the application database and its owning user are set to the default, app . If the PostgreSQL cluster being restored uses different names, you must specify them as documented in Configure the application database . You should also consider copying over the application user secret from the original cluster and keep it synchronized with the source. See \"About PostgreSQL Roles\" for more details. In the externalClusters section, remember to use the right namespace for the host in the connectionParameters sub-section. The -replication and -ca secrets should have been copied over if necessary, in case the replica cluster is in a separate namespace. externalClusters: - name: <MAIN-CLUSTER> connectionParameters: host: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-rw.<NAMESPACE>.svc user: streaming_replica sslmode: verify-full dbname: postgres sslKey: name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-replication key: tls.key sslCert: name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-replication key: tls.crt sslRootCert: name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-ca key: ca.crt Example of Standalone Replica Cluster from an object store The second example defines a replica cluster that bootstraps from an object store using the recovery section and continuous recovery using both streaming replication and the given object store. For streaming replication, the replica cluster connects to the source cluster using basic authentication. You can check the sample YAML for it in the samples/ subdirectory. Note the bootstrap and replica sections pointing to the source cluster. bootstrap: recovery: source: cluster-example replica: enabled: true source: cluster-example The previous configuration assumes that the application database and its owning user are set to the default, app . If the PostgreSQL cluster being restored uses different names, you must specify them as documented in Configure the application database . You should also consider copying over the application user secret from the original cluster and keep it synchronized with the source. See \"About PostgreSQL Roles\" for more details. In the externalClusters section, take care to use the right namespace in the endpointURL and the connectionParameters.host . And do ensure that the necessary secrets have been copied if necessary, and that a backup of the source cluster has been created already. externalClusters: - name: <MAIN-CLUSTER> barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://backups/ endpointURL: http://minio:9000 s3Credentials: \u2026 connectionParameters: host: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-rw.default.svc user: postgres dbname: postgres password: name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-superuser key: password Note To use streaming replication between the source cluster and the replica cluster, we need to make sure there is network connectivity between the two clusters, and that all the necessary secrets which hold passwords or certificates are properly created in advance. Example using a Volume Snapshot If you use volume snapshots and your storage class provides snapshots cross-cluster availability, you can leverage that to bootstrap a replica cluster through a volume snapshot of the source cluster. The third example defines a replica cluster that bootstraps from a volume snapshot using the recovery section. It uses streaming replication (via basic authentication) and the object store to fetch the WAL files. You can check the sample YAML for it in the samples/ subdirectory. The example assumes that the application database and its owning user are set to the default, app . If the PostgreSQL cluster being restored uses different names, you must specify them as documented in Configure the application database . You should also consider copying over the application user secret from the original cluster and keep it synchronized with the source. See \"About PostgreSQL Roles\" for more details. Delayed replicas CloudNativePG supports the creation of delayed replicas through the .spec.replica.minApplyDelay option , leveraging PostgreSQL's recovery_min_apply_delay . Delayed replicas are designed to intentionally lag behind the primary database by a specified amount of time. This delay is configurable using the .spec.replica.minApplyDelay option, which maps to the underlying recovery_min_apply_delay parameter in PostgreSQL. The primary objective of delayed replicas is to mitigate the impact of unintended SQL statement executions on the primary database. This is especially useful in scenarios where operations such as UPDATE or DELETE are performed without a proper WHERE clause. To configure a delay in a replica cluster, adjust the .spec.replica.minApplyDelay option. This parameter determines how much time the replicas will lag behind the primary. For example: # ... replica: enabled: true source: cluster-example # Enforce a delay of 8 hours minApplyDelay: '8h' # ... The above example helps safeguard against accidental data modifications by providing a buffer period of 8 hours to detect and correct issues before they propagate to the replicas. Monitor and adjust the delay as needed based on your recovery time objectives and the potential impact of unintended primary database operations. The main use cases of delayed replicas can be summarized into: mitigating human errors: reduce the risk of data corruption or loss resulting from unintentional SQL operations on the primary database recovery time optimization: facilitate quicker recovery from unintended changes by having a delayed replica that allows you to identify and rectify issues before changes are applied to other replicas. enhanced data protection: safeguard critical data by introducing a time buffer that provides an opportunity to intervene and prevent the propagation of undesirable changes. Warning The minApplyDelay option of delayed replicas cannot be used in conjunction with promotionToken . By integrating delayed replicas into your replication strategy, you can enhance the resilience and data protection capabilities of your PostgreSQL environment. Adjust the delay duration based on your specific needs and the criticality of your data. Important Always measure your goals. Depending on your environment, it might be more efficient to rely on volume snapshot-based recovery for faster outcomes. Evaluate and choose the approach that best aligns with your unique requirements and infrastructure.","title":"Replica clusters"},{"location":"replica_cluster/#replica-clusters","text":"Warning With the deprecation of native Barman Cloud support in CloudNativePG in favor of the Barman Cloud Plugin, this page\u2014and the backup and recovery documentation\u2014may undergo changes before the official release of version 1.26.0. A replica cluster is a CloudNativePG Cluster resource designed to replicate data from another PostgreSQL instance, ideally also managed by CloudNativePG. Typically, a replica cluster is deployed in a different Kubernetes cluster in another region. These clusters can be configured to perform cascading replication and can rely on object stores for data replication from the source, as detailed further down. There are primarily two use cases for replica clusters: Disaster Recovery and High Availability : Enhance disaster recovery and, to some extent, high availability of a CloudNativePG cluster across different Kubernetes clusters, typically located in different regions. In CloudNativePG terms, this is known as a \"Distributed Topology\" . Read-Only Workloads : Create standalone replicas of a PostgreSQL cluster for purposes such as reporting or Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). These replicas are primarily for read-only workloads.

First, conceptualize your distributed topology on paper, and then translate it into a CloudNativePG API configuration. This configuration primarily involves: The externalClusters section, which must be included in every Cluster definition within your distributed PostgreSQL setup. The .spec.replica stanza, specifically the primary , source , and (optionally) self fields. For example, suppose you want to deploy a PostgreSQL cluster distributed across two Kubernetes clusters located in Southern Europe and Central Europe. In this scenario, assume you have CloudNativePG installed in the Southern Europe Kubernetes cluster, with a PostgreSQL Cluster named cluster-eu-south acting as the primary. This cluster has continuous backup configured with a local object store. This object store is also accessible by the PostgreSQL Cluster named cluster-eu-central , installed in the Central European Kubernetes cluster. Initially, cluster-eu-central functions as a replica cluster. Following a symmetric approach, it also has a local object store for continuous backup, which needs to be read by cluster-eu-south . The recovery in this setup relies solely on WAL shipping, with no streaming connection between the two clusters. Here\u2019s how you would configure the externalClusters section for both Cluster resources: # Distributed topology configuration externalClusters: - name: cluster-eu-south barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://cluster-eu-south/ # Additional configuration - name: cluster-eu-central barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://cluster-eu-central/ # Additional configuration The .spec.replica stanza for the cluster-eu-south PostgreSQL primary Cluster should be configured as follows: replica: primary: cluster-eu-south source: cluster-eu-central Meanwhile, the .spec.replica stanza for the cluster-eu-central PostgreSQL replica Cluster should be configured as: replica: primary: cluster-eu-south source: cluster-eu-south In this configuration, when the primary field matches the name of the Cluster resource (or .spec.replica.self if a different one is used), the current cluster is considered the primary in the distributed topology. Otherwise, it is set as a replica from the source (in this case, using the Barman object store). This setup allows you to efficiently manage a distributed PostgreSQL architecture across multiple Kubernetes clusters, ensuring both high availability and disaster recovery through controlled switchover of a primary PostgreSQL cluster using declarative configuration. Controlled switchover in a distributed topology is a two-step process involving: Demotion of a primary cluster to a replica cluster Promotion of a replica cluster to a primary cluster These processes are described in the next sections.

The process involves demoting the current primary cluster (e.g., cluster-eu-south ) to a replica cluster and subsequently promoting the designated replica cluster (e.g., cluster-eu-central ) to primary when fully synchronized. Provided you have defined an external cluster in the current primary Cluster resource that points to the replica cluster that's been selected to become the new primary, all you need to do is change the primary field as follows: replica: primary: cluster-eu-central source: cluster-eu-central When the primary PostgreSQL cluster is demoted, write operations are no longer possible. CloudNativePG then: Archives the WAL file containing the shutdown checkpoint as a .partial file in the WAL archive.

The first step is necessary to demote/promote using solely the WAL archive to feed the continuous recovery process (without streaming replication). The second step, generation of the .status.demotionToken , will ensure a smooth demotion/promotion process, without any data loss and without rebuilding the former primary. At this stage, the former primary has transitioned to a replica cluster, awaiting WAL data from the new global primary: cluster-eu-central . To proceed with promoting the other cluster, you need to retrieve the demotionToken from cluster-eu-south using the following command: kubectl get cluster cluster-eu-south \\ -o jsonpath='{.status.demotionToken}' You can obtain the demotionToken using the cnpg plugin by checking the cluster's status. The token is listed under the Demotion token section. Note The demotionToken obtained from cluster-eu-south will serve as the promotionToken for cluster-eu-central .

Initially, CloudNativePG will wait for the designated primary cluster to replicate all Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) information up to the specified Log Sequence Number (LSN) contained in the token. Once this target is achieved, the promotion process will commence. The new primary cluster will switch timelines, archive the history file and new WAL, thereby unblocking the replication process in the cluster-eu-south cluster, which will then operate as a replica.

Primarily used to achieve high availability, physical replication also allows scale-out of read-only workloads and offloading of some work from the primary. Important This section is about replication within the same Cluster resource managed in the same Kubernetes cluster. For information about how to replicate with another Postgres Cluster resource, even across different Kubernetes clusters, please refer to the \"Replica clusters\" section. Application-level replication Having contributed throughout the years to the replication feature in PostgreSQL, we have decided to build high availability in CloudNativePG on top of the native physical replication technology, and integrate it directly in the Kubernetes API. In Kubernetes terms, this is referred to as application-level replication , in contrast with storage-level replication . A very mature technology PostgreSQL has a very robust and mature native framework for replicating data from the primary instance to one or more replicas, built around the concept of transactional changes continuously stored in the WAL (Write Ahead Log). Started as the evolution of crash recovery and point in time recovery technologies, physical replication was first introduced in PostgreSQL 8.2 (2006) through WAL shipping from the primary to a warm standby in continuous recovery. PostgreSQL 9.0 (2010) introduced WAL streaming and read-only replicas through hot standby . In 2011, PostgreSQL 9.1 brought synchronous replication at the transaction level, supporting RPO =0 clusters. Cascading replication was added in PostgreSQL 9.2 (2012). The foundations for logical replication were established in PostgreSQL 9.4 (2014), and version 10 (2017) introduced native support for the publisher/subscriber pattern to replicate data from an origin to a destination. The table below summarizes these milestones. Version Year Feature 8.2 2006 Warm Standby with WAL shipping 9.0 2010 Hot Standby and physical streaming replication 9.1 2011 Synchronous replication (priority-based) 9.2 2012 Cascading replication 9.4 2014 Foundations of logical replication 10 2017 Logical publisher/subscriber and quorum-based synchronous replication This table highlights key PostgreSQL replication features and their respective versions. Streaming replication support At the moment, CloudNativePG natively and transparently manages physical streaming replicas within a cluster in a declarative way, based on the number of provided instances in the spec : replicas = instances - 1 (where instances > 0) Immediately after the initialization of a cluster, the operator creates a user called streaming_replica as follows: CREATE USER streaming_replica WITH REPLICATION; -- NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEROLE NOCREATEDB NOBYPASSRLS Out of the box, the operator automatically sets up streaming replication within the cluster over an encrypted channel and enforces TLS client certificate authentication for the streaming_replica user - as highlighted by the following excerpt taken from pg_hba.conf : # Require client certificate authentication for the streaming_replica user hostssl postgres streaming_replica all cert hostssl replication streaming_replica all cert Certificates For details on how CloudNativePG manages certificates, please refer to the \"Certificates\" section in the documentation. If configured, the operator manages replication slots for all the replicas in the HA cluster, ensuring that WAL files required by each standby are retained on the primary's storage, even after a failover or switchover. Replication slots for High Availability For details on how CloudNativePG automatically manages replication slots for the High Availability replicas, please refer to the \"Replication slots for High Availability\" section below. Continuous backup integration In case continuous backup is configured in the cluster, CloudNativePG transparently configures replicas to take advantage of restore_command when in continuous recovery. As a result, PostgreSQL can use the WAL archive as a fallback option whenever pulling WALs via streaming replication fails. Synchronous Replication CloudNativePG supports both quorum-based and priority-based synchronous replication for PostgreSQL . Warning By default, synchronous replication pauses write operations if the required number of standby nodes for WAL replication during transaction commits is unavailable. This behavior prioritizes data durability and aligns with PostgreSQL DBA best practices. However, if self-healing is a higher priority than strict data durability in your setup, this setting can be adjusted. For details on managing this behavior, refer to the Data Durability and Synchronous Replication section. Direct configuration of the synchronous_standby_names option is not permitted. However, CloudNativePG automatically populates this option with the names of local pods, while also allowing customization to extend synchronous replication beyond the Cluster resource. This can be achieved through the .spec.postgresql.synchronous stanza . Synchronous replication is disabled by default (the synchronous stanza is not defined). When defined, two options are mandatory: method : either any (quorum) or first (priority) number : the number of synchronous standby servers that transactions must wait for responses from Quorum-based Synchronous Replication In PostgreSQL, quorum-based synchronous replication ensures that transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to a specified number of standbys. To enable this, set the method to any . This replication method is the most common setup for a CloudNativePG cluster. Example The example below, based on a typical cluster-example configuration with three instances, sets up quorum-based synchronous replication with at least one instance: postgresql: synchronous: method: any number: 1 With this configuration, CloudNativePG automatically sets the content of synchronous_standby_names as follows: ANY 1 (cluster-example-2, cluster-example-3, cluster-example-1) Migrating from Deprecated Synchronous Replication Implementation This section outlines how to migrate from the deprecated quorum-based synchronous replication format to the newer, more robust implementation in CloudNativePG. Given the following manifest: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: angus spec: instances: 3 minSyncReplicas: 1 maxSyncReplicas: 1 storage: size: 1G You can update it to the new format as follows: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: angus spec: instances: 3 storage: size: 1G postgresql: synchronous: method: any number: 1 dataDurability: required To prioritize self-healing over strict data durability, set dataDurability to preferred instead. Priority-based Synchronous Replication PostgreSQL's priority-based synchronous replication makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to the requested number of synchronous standbys chosen based on their priorities. Standbys listed earlier in the synchronous_standby_names option are given higher priority and considered synchronous. If a current synchronous standby disconnects, it is immediately replaced by the next-highest-priority standby. To use this method, set method to first . Important Currently, this method is most useful when extending synchronous replication beyond the current cluster using the maxStandbyNamesFromCluster , standbyNamesPre , and standbyNamesPost options explained below. Controlling synchronous_standby_names Content By default, CloudNativePG populates synchronous_standby_names with the names of local pods in a Cluster resource, ensuring synchronous replication within the PostgreSQL cluster. You can customize the content of synchronous_standby_names based on your requirements and replication method (quorum or priority) using the following optional parameters in the .spec.postgresql.synchronous stanza: maxStandbyNamesFromCluster : the maximum number of pod names from the local Cluster object that can be automatically included in the synchronous_standby_names option in PostgreSQL. standbyNamesPre : a list of standby names (specifically application_name ) to be prepended to the list of local pod names automatically listed by the operator. standbyNamesPost : a list of standby names (specifically application_name ) to be appended to the list of local pod names automatically listed by the operator. Warning You are responsible for ensuring the correct names in standbyNamesPre and standbyNamesPost . CloudNativePG expects that you manage any standby with an application_name listed here, ensuring their high availability. Incorrect entries can jeopardize your PostgreSQL database uptime. Examples Here are some examples, all based on a cluster-example with three instances: If you set: postgresql: synchronous: method: any number: 1 maxStandbyNamesFromCluster: 1 standbyNamesPre: - angus The content of synchronous_standby_names will be: ANY 1 (angus, cluster-example-2) If you set: postgresql: synchronous: method: any number: 1 maxStandbyNamesFromCluster: 0 standbyNamesPre: - angus - malcolm The content of synchronous_standby_names will be: ANY 1 (angus, malcolm) If you set: postgresql: synchronous: method: first number: 2 maxStandbyNamesFromCluster: 1 standbyNamesPre: - angus standbyNamesPost: - malcolm The synchronous_standby_names option will look like: FIRST 2 (angus, cluster-example-2, malcolm) Data Durability and Synchronous Replication The dataDurability option in the .spec.postgresql.synchronous stanza controls the trade-off between data safety and availability for synchronous replication. It can be set to required or preferred , with the default being required if not specified. Important preferred can only be used when standbyNamesPre and standbyNamesPost are unset. Required Data Durability When dataDurability is set to required , PostgreSQL only considers transactions committed once WAL (Write-Ahead Log) records have been replicated to the specified number of synchronous standbys. This setting prioritizes data safety over availability, meaning write operations will pause if the required number of synchronous standbys is unavailable. This ensures zero data loss (RPO=0) but may reduce database availability during network disruptions or standby failures. Synchronous standbys are selected in this priority order: Healthy instances Unhealthy instances Primary The list is then truncated based on maxStandbyNamesFromCluster if this value is set, prioritizing healthy instances and ensuring synchronous_standby_names is populated. Example Consider the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: foo spec: instances: 3 postgresql: synchronous: method: any number: 1 dataDurability: required Initial state. The content of synchronous_standby_names is: ANY 1 (\"foo-2\",\"foo-3\",\"foo-1\") foo-2 becomes unavailable. It gets pushed back in priority: ANY 1 (\"foo-3\",\"foo-2\",\"foo-1\") foo-3 also becomes unavailable. The list contains no healthy standbys: ANY 1 (\"foo-2\",\"foo-3\",\"foo-1\") At this point no write operations will be allowed until at least one of the standbys is available again. When the standbys are available again, synchronous_standby_names will be back to the initial state. Preferred Data Durability When dataDurability is set to preferred , the required number of synchronous instances adjusts based on the number of available standbys. PostgreSQL will attempt to replicate WAL records to the designated number of synchronous standbys, but write operations will continue even if fewer than the requested number of standbys are available. Important Make sure you have a clear understanding of what ready/available means for a replica and set your expectations accordingly. By default, a replica is considered ready when it has successfully connected to the source at least once. However, CloudNativePG allows you to configure startup and readiness probes for replicas based on maximum lag. For more details, please refer to the \"Postgres instance manager\" section . This setting balances data safety with availability, enabling applications to continue writing during temporary standby unavailability\u2014hence, it\u2019s also known as self-healing mode . Warning This mode may result in data loss if all standbys become unavailable. With preferred data durability, only healthy replicas are included in synchronous_standby_names . Example Consider the following example. For demonstration, we\u2019ll use a cluster named bar with 5 instances and 2 synchronous standbys: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: bar spec: instances: 5 postgresql: synchronous: method: any number: 2 dataDurability: preferred Initial state. The content of synchronous_standby_names is: ANY 2 (\"bar-2\",\"bar-3\", \"bar-4\", \"bar-5\") bar-2 and bar-3 become unavailable. They are removed from the list: ANY 2 (\"bar-4\", \"bar-5\") bar-4 also becomes unavailable. It gets removed from the list. Since the number of available standbys is less than the requested number, the requested amount gets reduced: ANY 1 (\"bar-5\") bar-5 also becomes unavailable. synchronous_standby_names becomes empty, disabling synchronous replication completely. Write operations will continue, but with the risk of potential data loss in case of a primary failure. When the replicas are back, synchronous_standby_names will be back to the initial state. Synchronous Replication (Deprecated) Warning Prior to CloudNativePG 1.24, only the quorum-based synchronous replication implementation was supported. Although this method is now deprecated, it will not be removed anytime soon. The new method prioritizes data durability over self-healing and offers more robust features, including priority-based synchronous replication and full control over the synchronous_standby_names option. It is recommended to gradually migrate to the new configuration method for synchronous replication, as explained in the previous paragraph. Important The deprecated method and the new method are mutually exclusive. CloudNativePG supports the configuration of quorum-based synchronous streaming replication via two configuration options called minSyncReplicas and maxSyncReplicas , which are the minimum and the maximum number of expected synchronous standby replicas available at any time. For self-healing purposes, the operator always compares these two values with the number of available replicas to determine the quorum. Important By default, synchronous replication selects among all the available replicas indistinctively. You can limit on which nodes your synchronous replicas can be scheduled, by working on node labels through the syncReplicaElectionConstraint option as described in the next section. Synchronous replication is disabled by default ( minSyncReplicas and maxSyncReplicas are not defined). In case both minSyncReplicas and maxSyncReplicas are set, CloudNativePG automatically updates the synchronous_standby_names option in PostgreSQL to the following value: ANY q (pod1, pod2, ...) Where: q is an integer automatically calculated by the operator to be: 1 <= minSyncReplicas <= q <= maxSyncReplicas <= readyReplicas pod1, pod2, ... is the list of all PostgreSQL pods in the cluster Warning To provide self-healing capabilities, the operator can ignore minSyncReplicas if such value is higher than the currently available number of replicas. Synchronous replication is automatically disabled when readyReplicas is 0 . As stated in the PostgreSQL documentation , the method ANY specifies a quorum-based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to at least the requested number of synchronous standbys in the list . Important Even though the operator chooses self-healing over enforcement of synchronous replication settings, our recommendation is to plan for synchronous replication only in clusters with 3+ instances or, more generally, when maxSyncReplicas < (instances - 1) . Select nodes for synchronous replication CloudNativePG enables you to select which PostgreSQL instances are eligible to participate in a quorum-based synchronous replication set through anti-affinity rules based on the node labels where the PVC holding the PGDATA and the Postgres pod are. Scheduling For more information on the general pod affinity and anti-affinity rules, please check the \"Scheduling\" section . Warning The .spec.postgresql.syncReplicaElectionConstraint option only applies to the legacy implementation of synchronous replication (see \"Synchronous Replication (Deprecated)\" ). As an example use-case for this feature: in a cluster with a single sync replica, we would be able to ensure the sync replica will be in a different availability zone from the primary instance, usually identified by the topology.kubernetes.io/zone label on a node . This would increase the robustness of the cluster in case of an outage in a single availability zone, especially in terms of recovery point objective ( RPO ). The idea of anti-affinity is to ensure that sync replicas that participate in the quorum are chosen from pods running on nodes that have different values for the selected labels (in this case, the availability zone label) then the node where the primary is currently in execution. If no node matches such criteria, the replicas are eligible for synchronous replication. Important The self-healing enforcement still applies while defining additional constraints for synchronous replica election (see \"Synchronous replication\" ). The example below shows how this can be done through the syncReplicaElectionConstraint section within .spec.postgresql . nodeLabelsAntiAffinity allows you to specify those node labels that need to be evaluated to make sure that synchronous replication will be dynamically configured by the operator between the current primary and the replicas which are located on nodes having a value of the availability zone label different from that of the node where the primary is: spec: instances: 3 postgresql: syncReplicaElectionConstraint: enabled: true nodeLabelsAntiAffinity: - topology.kubernetes.io/zone As you can imagine, the availability zone is just an example, but you could customize this behavior based on other labels that describe the node, such as storage, CPU, or memory. Replication slots Replication slots are a native PostgreSQL feature introduced in 9.4 that provides an automated way to ensure that the primary does not remove WAL segments until all the attached streaming replication clients have received them, and that the primary does not remove rows which could cause a recovery conflict even when the standby is ( temporarily) disconnected. A replication slot exists solely on the instance that created it, and PostgreSQL does not replicate it on the standby servers. As a result, after a failover or a switchover, the new primary does not contain the replication slot from the old primary. This can create problems for the streaming replication clients that were connected to the old primary and have lost their slot. CloudNativePG provides a turn-key solution to synchronize the content of physical replication slots from the primary to each standby, addressing two use cases: the replication slots automatically created for the High Availability of the Postgres cluster ( see \"Replication slots for High Availability\" below for details) user-defined replication slots created on the primary Replication slots for High Availability CloudNativePG fills this gap by introducing the concept of cluster-managed replication slots, starting with high availability clusters. This feature automatically manages physical replication slots for each hot standby replica in the High Availability cluster, both in the primary and the standby. In CloudNativePG, we use the terms: Primary HA slot : a physical replication slot whose lifecycle is entirely managed by the current primary of the cluster and whose purpose is to map to a specific standby in streaming replication. Such a slot lives on the primary only. Standby HA slot : a physical replication slot for a standby whose lifecycle is entirely managed by another standby in the cluster, based on the content of the pg_replication_slots view in the primary, and updated at regular intervals using pg_replication_slot_advance() . This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled via configuration. For details, please refer to the \"replicationSlots\" section in the API reference . Here follows a brief description of the main options: .spec.replicationSlots.highAvailability.enabled if true , the feature is enabled ( true is the default) .spec.replicationSlots.highAvailability.slotPrefix the prefix that identifies replication slots managed by the operator for this feature (default: _cnpg_ ) .spec.replicationSlots.updateInterval how often the standby synchronizes the position of the local copy of the replication slots with the position on the current primary, expressed in seconds (default: 30) Although it is not recommended, if you desire a different behavior, you can customize the above options. For example, the following manifest will create a cluster with replication slots disabled. apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 # Disable replication slots for HA in the cluster replicationSlots: highAvailability: enabled: false storage: size: 1Gi User-Defined Replication slots Although CloudNativePG doesn't support a way to declaratively define physical replication slots, you can still create your own slots via SQL . Information At the moment, we don't have any plans to manage replication slots in a declarative way, but it might change depending on the feedback we receive from users. The reason is that replication slots exist for a specific purpose and each should be managed by a specific application the oversees the entire lifecycle of the slot on the primary. CloudNativePG can manage the synchronization of any user managed physical replication slots between the primary and standbys, similarly to what it does for the HA replication slots explained above (the only difference is that you need to create the replication slot). This feature is enabled by default (meaning that any replication slot is synchronized), but you can disable it or further customize its behavior (for example by excluding some slots using regular expressions) through the synchronizeReplicas stanza. For example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 replicationSlots: synchronizeReplicas: enabled: true excludePatterns: - \"^foo\" For details, please refer to the \"replicationSlots\" section in the API reference . Here follows a brief description of the main options: .spec.replicationSlots.synchronizeReplicas.enabled When true or not specified, every user-defined replication slot on the primary is synchronized on each standby. If changed to false, the operator will remove any replication slot previously created by itself on each standby. .spec.replicationSlots.synchronizeReplicas.excludePatterns A list of regular expression patterns to match the names of user-defined replication slots to be excluded from synchronization. This can be useful to exclude specific slots based on naming conventions. Warning Users utilizing this feature should carefully monitor user-defined replication slots to ensure they align with their operational requirements and do not interfere with the failover process. Synchronization frequency You can also control the frequency with which a standby queries the pg_replication_slots view on the primary, and updates its local copy of the replication slots, like in this example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 # Reduce the frequency of standby HA slots updates to once every 5 minutes replicationSlots: updateInterval: 300 storage: size: 1Gi Capping the WAL size retained for replication slots When replication slots is enabled, you might end up running out of disk space due to PostgreSQL trying to retain WAL files requested by a replication slot. This might happen due to a standby that is (temporarily?) down, or lagging, or simply an orphan replication slot. Starting with PostgreSQL 13, you can take advantage of the max_slot_wal_keep_size configuration option controlling the maximum size of WAL files that replication slots are allowed to retain in the pg_wal directory at checkpoint time. By default, in PostgreSQL max_slot_wal_keep_size is set to -1 , meaning that replication slots may retain an unlimited amount of WAL files. As a result, our recommendation is to explicitly set max_slot_wal_keep_size when replication slots support is enabled. For example: # ... postgresql: parameters: max_slot_wal_keep_size: \"10GB\" # ... Monitoring replication slots Replication slots must be carefully monitored in your infrastructure. By default, we provide the pg_replication_slots metric in our Prometheus exporter with key information such as the name of the slot, the type, whether it is active, the lag from the primary.

By default, they might be allowed to use as much CPU and RAM as needed. CloudNativePG allows administrators to control and manage resource usage by the pods of the cluster, through the resources section of the manifest, with two knobs: requests : initial requirement limits : maximum usage, in case of dynamic increase of resource needs For example, you can request an initial amount of RAM of 32MiB (scalable to 128MiB) and 50m of CPU (scalable to 100m) as follows: resources: requests: memory: \"32Mi\" cpu: \"50m\" limits: memory: \"128Mi\" cpu: \"100m\" Memory requests and limits are associated with containers, but it is useful to think of a pod as having a memory request and limit. The pod's memory request is the sum of the memory requests for all the containers in the pod. Pod scheduling is based on requests and not on limits. A pod is scheduled to run on a Node only if the Node has enough available memory to satisfy the pod's memory request. For each resource, we divide containers into 3 Quality of Service (QoS) classes, in decreasing order of priority: Guaranteed Burstable Best-Effort For more details, please refer to the \"Configure Quality of Service for Pods\" section in the Kubernetes documentation. For a PostgreSQL workload it is recommended to set a \"Guaranteed\" QoS. To avoid resources related issues in Kubernetes, we can refer to the best practices for \"out of resource\" handling while creating a cluster: Specify your required values for memory and CPU in the resources section of the manifest file. This way, you can avoid the OOM Killed (where \"OOM\" stands for Out Of Memory) and CPU throttle or any other resource-related issues on running instances. For your cluster's pods to get assigned to the \"Guaranteed\" QoS class, you must set limits and requests for both memory and CPU to the same value. Specify your required PostgreSQL memory parameters consistently with the pod resources (as you would do in a VM or physical machine scenario - see below). Set up database server pods on a dedicated node using nodeSelector. See the \"nodeSelector\" and \"tolerations\" fields of the \u201caffinityconfiguration\" resource on the API reference page. You can refer to the following example manifest: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: postgresql-resources spec: instances: 3 postgresql: parameters: shared_buffers: \"256MB\" resources: requests: memory: \"1024Mi\" cpu: 1 limits: memory: \"1024Mi\" cpu: 1 storage: size: 1Gi In the above example, we have specified shared_buffers parameter with a value of 256MB - i.e., how much memory is dedicated to the PostgreSQL server for caching data (the default value for this parameter is 128MB in case it's not defined). A reasonable starting value for shared_buffers is 25% of the memory in your system. For example: if your shared_buffers is 256 MB, then the recommended value for your container memory size is 1 GB, which means that within a pod all the containers will have a total of 1 GB memory that Kubernetes will always preserve, enabling our containers to work as expected.

Kubernetes documentation Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on scheduling, including all the available policies. On this page we assume you are familiar with concepts like affinity, anti-affinity, node selectors, and so on. You can control how the CloudNativePG cluster's instances should be scheduled through the affinity section in the definition of the cluster, which supports: pod affinity/anti-affinity node selectors tolerations Pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity Kubernetes provides mechanisms to control where pods are scheduled using affinity and anti-affinity rules. These rules allow you to specify whether a pod should be scheduled on particular nodes ( affinity ) or avoided on specific nodes ( anti-affinity ) based on the workloads already running there. This capability is technically referred to as inter-pod affinity/anti-affinity . By default, CloudNativePG configures cluster instances to preferably be scheduled on different nodes, while pgBouncer instances might still run on the same nodes. For example, given the following Cluster specification: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:17.4 affinity: enablePodAntiAffinity: true # Default value topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname # Default value podAntiAffinityType: preferred # Default value storage: size: 1Gi The affinity configuration applied in the instance pods will be: affinity: podAntiAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: cnpg.io/cluster operator: In values: - cluster-example - key: cnpg.io/podRole operator: In values: - instance topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname weight: 100 With this setup, Kubernetes will prefer to schedule a 3-node PostgreSQL cluster across three different nodes, assuming sufficient resources are available. Requiring Pod Anti-Affinity You can modify the default behavior by adjusting the settings mentioned above. For example, setting podAntiAffinityType to required will enforce requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution instead of preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution . However, be aware that this strict requirement may cause pods to remain pending if resources are insufficient\u2014this is particularly relevant when using Cluster Autoscaler for automated horizontal scaling in a Kubernetes cluster. Inter-pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity For more details, refer to the Kubernetes documentation . Topology Considerations In cloud environments, you might consider using topology.kubernetes.io/zone as the topologyKey to ensure pods are distributed across different availability zones rather than just nodes. For more options, see Well-Known Labels, Annotations, and Taints . Disabling Anti-Affinity Policies If needed, you can disable the operator-generated anti-affinity policies by setting enablePodAntiAffinity to false . Fine-Grained Control with Custom Rules For scenarios requiring more precise control, you can specify custom pod affinity or anti-affinity rules using the additionalPodAffinity and additionalPodAntiAffinity configuration attributes. These custom rules will be added to those generated by the operator, if enabled, or used directly if the operator-generated rules are disabled. Note When using additionalPodAntiAffinity or additionalPodAffinity , you must provide the full podAntiAffinity or podAffinity structure expected by the Pod specification. The following YAML example demonstrates how to configure only one instance of PostgreSQL per worker node, regardless of which PostgreSQL cluster it belongs to: additionalPodAntiAffinity: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: postgresql operator: Exists values: [] topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\" Node selection through nodeSelector Kubernetes allows nodeSelector to provide a list of labels (defined as key-value pairs) to select the nodes on which a pod can run. Specifically, the node must have each indicated key-value pair as labels for the pod to be scheduled and run. Similarly, CloudNativePG consents you to define a nodeSelector in the affinity section, so that you can request a PostgreSQL cluster to run only on nodes that have those labels. Tolerations Kubernetes allows you to specify (through taints ) whether a node should repel all pods not explicitly tolerating (through tolerations ) their taints . So, by setting a proper set of tolerations for a workload matching a specific node's taints , Kubernetes scheduler will now take into consideration the tainted node, while deciding on which node to schedule the workload. Tolerations can be configured for all the pods of a Cluster through the .spec.affinity.tolerations section, which accepts the usual Kubernetes syntax for tolerations. Taints and Tolerations More information on taints and tolerations can be found in the Kubernetes documentation . Isolating PostgreSQL workloads Important Before proceeding, please ensure you have read the \"Architecture\" section of the documentation. While you can deploy PostgreSQL on Kubernetes in various ways, we recommend following these essential principles for production environments: Exploit Availability Zones: If possible, take advantage of availability zones (AZs) within the same Kubernetes cluster by distributing PostgreSQL instances across different AZs. Dedicate Worker Nodes: Allocate specific worker nodes for PostgreSQL workloads through the node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres label and taint, as detailed in the Reserving Nodes for PostgreSQL Workloads section. Avoid Node Overlap: Ensure that no instances from the same PostgreSQL cluster are running on the same node. As explained in greater detail in the previous sections, CloudNativePG provides the flexibility to configure pod anti-affinity, node selectors, and tolerations. Below is a sample configuration to ensure that a PostgreSQL Cluster is deployed on postgres nodes, with its instances distributed across different nodes: # <snip> affinity: enablePodAntiAffinity: true topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname podAntiAffinityType: required nodeSelector: node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres: \"\" tolerations: - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres operator: Exists effect: NoSchedule # <snip> Despite its simplicity, this setup ensures optimal distribution and isolation of PostgreSQL workloads, leading to enhanced performance and reliability in your production environment.","title":"Scheduling"},{"location":"scheduling/#scheduling","text":"Scheduling, in Kubernetes, is the process responsible for placing a new pod on the best node possible, based on several criteria.

You can control how the CloudNativePG cluster's instances should be scheduled through the affinity section in the definition of the cluster, which supports: pod affinity/anti-affinity node selectors tolerations","title":"Scheduling"},{"location":"scheduling/#pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity","text":"Kubernetes provides mechanisms to control where pods are scheduled using affinity and anti-affinity rules. These rules allow you to specify whether a pod should be scheduled on particular nodes ( affinity ) or avoided on specific nodes ( anti-affinity ) based on the workloads already running there. This capability is technically referred to as inter-pod affinity/anti-affinity . By default, CloudNativePG configures cluster instances to preferably be scheduled on different nodes, while pgBouncer instances might still run on the same nodes. For example, given the following Cluster specification: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:17.4 affinity: enablePodAntiAffinity: true # Default value topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname # Default value podAntiAffinityType: preferred # Default value storage: size: 1Gi The affinity configuration applied in the instance pods will be: affinity: podAntiAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: cnpg.io/cluster operator: In values: - cluster-example - key: cnpg.io/podRole operator: In values: - instance topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname weight: 100 With this setup, Kubernetes will prefer to schedule a 3-node PostgreSQL cluster across three different nodes, assuming sufficient resources are available.","title":"Pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity"},{"location":"scheduling/#requiring-pod-anti-affinity","text":"You can modify the default behavior by adjusting the settings mentioned above.

Dedicate Worker Nodes: Allocate specific worker nodes for PostgreSQL workloads through the node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres label and taint, as detailed in the Reserving Nodes for PostgreSQL Workloads section. Avoid Node Overlap: Ensure that no instances from the same PostgreSQL cluster are running on the same node.

Warning The information contained in this page must not exonerate you from performing regular InfoSec duties on your Kubernetes cluster. Please familiarize yourself with the \"Overview of Cloud Native Security\" page from the Kubernetes documentation. About the 4C's Security Model Please refer to \"The 4C\u2019s Security Model in Kubernetes\" blog article to get a better understanding and context of the approach EDB has taken with security in CloudNativePG. Code CloudNativePG's source code undergoes systematic static analysis, including checks for security vulnerabilities, using the popular open-source linter for Go, GolangCI-Lint , directly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. GolangCI-Lint can run multiple linters on the same source code. The following tools are used to identify security issues: Golang Security Checker ( gosec ): A linter that scans the abstract syntax tree of the source code against a set of rules designed to detect known vulnerabilities, threats, and weaknesses, such as hard-coded credentials, integer overflows, and SQL injections. GolangCI-Lint runs gosec as part of its suite. govulncheck : This tool runs in the CI/CD pipeline and reports known vulnerabilities affecting Go code or the compiler. If the operator is built with a version of the Go compiler containing a known vulnerability, govulncheck will detect it. CodeQL : Provided by GitHub, this tool scans for security issues and blocks any pull request with detected vulnerabilities. CodeQL is configured to review only Go code, excluding other languages in the repository such as Python or Bash. Snyk : Conducts nightly code scans in a scheduled job and generates weekly reports highlighting any new findings related to code security and licensing issues. The CloudNativePG repository has the \"Private vulnerability reporting\" option enabled in the Security section . This feature allows users to safely report security issues that require careful handling before being publicly disclosed. If you discover any security bug, please use this medium to report it. Important A failure in the static code analysis phase of the CI/CD pipeline will block the entire delivery process of CloudNativePG. Every commit must pass all the linters defined by GolangCI-Lint. Container Every container image in CloudNativePG is automatically built via CI/CD pipelines after every commit. These images include not only the operator's image but also the operands' images, specifically for every supported PostgreSQL version. Important All operand images are automatically and regularly rebuilt by our pipelines to incorporate the latest security updates at both the base image and package levels. This ensures that container images distributed to the community receive patch-level updates regularly. During the CI/CD process, images are scanned using the following tools: Dockle : Ensures best practices in the container build process. Snyk : Detects security issues within the container and reports findings via the GitHub interface. Image Signatures The operator and operand images are cryptographically signed using cosign , a signature tool from sigstore . This process is automated via GitHub Actions and leverages short-lived tokens issued through OpenID Connect . The token issuer is https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com , and the signing identity corresponds to a GitHub workflow executed under the cloudnative-pg repository. This workflow uses the cosign-installer action to streamline the signing process. To verify the authenticity of an operator image, use the following cosign command with the image digest: cosign verify ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg@sha256:<DIGEST> \\ --certificate-identity-regexp=\"^https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/\" \\ --certificate-oidc-issuer=\"https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\" Attestations Container images include the following attestations for transparency and traceability: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) : A comprehensive list of software artifacts included in the image or used during its build process, formatted using the in-toto SPDX predicate standard . Provenance : Metadata detailing how the image was built, following the SLSA Provenance framework. You can retrieve the SBOM for a specific image and platform using the following command: docker buildx imagetools inspect <IMAGE> \\ --format '{{ json (index .SBOM \"<PLATFORM>\").SPDX }}' This command outputs the SBOM in JSON format, providing a detailed view of the software components and build dependencies. For the provenance, use: docker buildx imagetools inspect <IMAGE> \\ --format '{{ json (index .Provenance \"<PLATFORM>\").SLSA }}' Guidelines and Frameworks for Container Security The following guidelines and frameworks have been considered for ensuring container-level security: \"Container Image Creation and Deployment Guide\" : Developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). \"CIS Benchmark for Docker\" : Developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). About Container-Level Security For more information on the approach that EDB has taken regarding security at the container level in CloudNativePG, please refer to the blog article \"Security and Containers in CloudNativePG\" . Cluster Security at the cluster level takes into account all Kubernetes components that form both the control plane and the nodes, as well as the applications that run in the cluster (PostgreSQL included). Role Based Access Control (RBAC) The operator interacts with the Kubernetes API server using a dedicated service account named cnpg-manager . This service account is typically installed in the operator namespace, commonly cnpg-system . However, the namespace may vary based on the deployment method (see the subsection below). In the same namespace, there is a binding between the cnpg-manager service account and a role. The specific name and type of this role (either Role or ClusterRole ) also depend on the deployment method. This role defines the necessary permissions required by the operator to function correctly. To learn more about these roles, you can use the kubectl describe clusterrole or kubectl describe role commands, depending on the deployment method. Important The above permissions are exclusively reserved for the operator's service account to interact with the Kubernetes API server. They are not directly accessible by the users of the operator that interact only with Cluster , Pooler , Backup , ScheduledBackup , Database , Publication , Subscription , ImageCatalog and ClusterImageCatalog resources. Below we provide some examples and, most importantly, the reasons why CloudNativePG requires full or partial management of standard Kubernetes namespaced or non-namespaced resources. configmaps The operator needs to create and manage default config maps for the Prometheus exporter monitoring metrics. deployments The operator needs to manage a PgBouncer connection pooler using a standard Kubernetes Deployment resource. jobs The operator needs to handle jobs to manage different Cluster 's phases. persistentvolumeclaims The volume where the PGDATA resides is the central element of a PostgreSQL Cluster resource; the operator needs to interact with the selected storage class to dynamically provision the requested volumes, based on the defined scheduling policies. pods The operator needs to manage Cluster 's instances. secrets Unless you provide certificates and passwords to your Cluster objects, the operator adopts the \"convention over configuration\" paradigm by self-provisioning random generated passwords and TLS certificates, and by storing them in secrets. serviceaccounts The operator needs to create a service account that enables the instance manager (which is the PID 1 process of the container that controls the PostgreSQL server) to safely communicate with the Kubernetes API server to coordinate actions and continuously provide a reliable status of the Cluster . services The operator needs to control network access to the PostgreSQL cluster (or the connection pooler) from applications, and properly manage failover/switchover operations in an automated way (by assigning, for example, the correct end-point of a service to the proper primary PostgreSQL instance). validatingwebhookconfigurations and mutatingwebhookconfigurations The operator injects its self-signed webhook CA into both webhook configurations, which are needed to validate and mutate all the resources it manages. For more details, please see the Kubernetes documentation . volumesnapshots The operator needs to generate VolumeSnapshots objects in order to take backups of a PostgreSQL server. VolumeSnapshots are read too in order to validate them before starting the restore process. nodes The operator needs to get the labels for Affinity and AntiAffinity so it can decide in which nodes a pod can be scheduled. This is useful, for example, to prevent the replicas from being scheduled in the same node - especially important if nodes are in different availability zones. This permission is also used to determine whether a node is scheduled, preventing the creation of pods on unscheduled nodes, or triggering a switchover if the primary lives in an unscheduled node. Deployments and ClusterRole Resources As mentioned above, each deployment method may have variations in the namespace location of the service account, as well as the names and types of role bindings and respective roles. Via Kubernetes Manifest When installing CloudNativePG using the Kubernetes manifest, permissions are set to ClusterRoleBinding by default. You can inspect the permissions required by the operator by running: kubectl describe clusterrole cnpg-manager Via OLM From a security perspective, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) provides a more flexible deployment method. It allows you to configure the operator to watch either all namespaces or specific namespaces, enabling more granular permission management. Info OLM allows you to deploy the operator in its own namespace and configure it to watch specific namespaces used for CloudNativePG clusters. This setup helps to contain permissions and restrict access more effectively. Why Are ClusterRole Permissions Needed? The operator currently requires ClusterRole permissions to read nodes and ClusterImageCatalog objects. All other permissions can be namespace-scoped (i.e., Role ) or cluster-wide (i.e., ClusterRole ). Even with these permissions, if someone gains access to the ServiceAccount , they will only have get , list , and watch permissions, which are limited to viewing resources. However, if an unauthorized user gains access to the ServiceAccount , it indicates a more significant security issue. Therefore, it's crucial to prevent users from accessing the operator's ServiceAccount and any other ServiceAccount with elevated permissions. Calls to the API server made by the instance manager The instance manager, which is the entry point of the operand container, needs to make some calls to the Kubernetes API server to ensure that the status of some resources is correctly updated and to access the config maps and secrets that are associated with that Postgres cluster. Such calls are performed through a dedicated ServiceAccount created by the operator that shares the same PostgreSQL Cluster resource name. Important The operand can only access a specific and limited subset of resources through the API server. A service account is the recommended way to access the API server from within a Pod . For transparency, the permissions associated with the service account are defined in the roles.go file. For example, to retrieve the permissions of a generic mypg cluster in the myns namespace, you can type the following command: kubectl get role -n myns mypg -o yaml Then verify that the role is bound to the service account: kubectl get rolebinding -n myns mypg -o yaml Important Remember that roles are limited to a given namespace . Below we provide a quick summary of the permissions associated with the service account for generic Kubernetes resources. configmaps The instance manager can only read config maps that are related to the same cluster, such as custom monitoring queries secrets The instance manager can only read secrets that are related to the same cluster, namely: streaming replication user, application user, super user, LDAP authentication user, client CA, server CA, server certificate, backup credentials, custom monitoring queries events The instance manager can create an event for the cluster, informing the API server about a particular aspect of the PostgreSQL instance lifecycle Here instead, we provide the same summary for resources specific to CloudNativePG. clusters The instance manager requires read-only permissions, namely get , list and watch , just for its own Cluster resource clusters/status The instance manager requires to update and patch the status of just its own Cluster resource backups The instance manager requires get and list permissions to read any Backup resource in the namespace. Additionally, it requires the delete permission to clean up the Kubernetes cluster by removing the Backup objects that do not have a counterpart in the object store - typically because of retention policies backups/status The instance manager requires to update and patch the status of any Backup resource in the namespace Pod and Container Security Contexts A Security Context defines privilege and access control settings for a pod or container. CloudNativePG does not require privileged mode for container execution. The PostgreSQL containers run as the postgres system user. No component whatsoever requires running as root . Likewise, Volume access does not require privileged mode nor root privileges. Proper permissions must be assigned by the Kubernetes platform and/or administrators. The PostgreSQL containers run with a read-only root filesystem (i.e. no writable layer). The operator manages the setting of security contexts for all pods and containers of a PostgreSQL cluster. The Seccomp Profile to be used for the PostgreSQL containers can be configured with the spec.seccompProfile section of the Cluster resource. If this section is left blank, the containers will use a seccompProfile Type of RuntimeDefault , that is, the container runtime default. The security context of PostgreSQL containers using the default seccompProfile will look like this: securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: false capabilities: drop: - ALL privileged: false readOnlyRootFilesystem: true runAsNonRoot: true seccompProfile: type: RuntimeDefault Security Context Constraints When running in an environment that is utilizing Security Context Constraints (SCC) the operator does not explicitly set the security context of the PostgreSQL cluster pods, but rather allows the pods to inherit the restricted Security Context Constraints that are already defined. Restricting Pod access using AppArmor You can assign an AppArmor profile to the postgres , initdb , join , full-recovery and bootstrap-controller containers inside every Cluster pod through the container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io annotation. Example of cluster annotations kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-apparmor annotations: container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/postgres: runtime/default container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/initdb: runtime/default container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/join: runtime/default Warning Using this kind of annotations can result in your cluster to stop working. If this is the case, the annotation can be safely removed from the Cluster . The AppArmor configuration must be at Kubernetes node level, meaning that the underlying operating system must have this option enable and properly configured. In case this is not the situation, and the annotations were added at the Cluster creation time, pods will not be created. On the other hand, if you add the annotations after the Cluster was created the pods in the cluster will be unable to start and you will get an error like this: metadata.annotations[container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/postgres]: Forbidden: may not add AppArmor annotations] In such cases, please refer to your Kubernetes administrators and ask for the proper AppArmor profile to use. Network Policies The pods created by the Cluster resource can be controlled by Kubernetes network policies to enable/disable inbound and outbound network access at IP and TCP level. You can find more information in the networking document . Important The operator needs to communicate to each instance on TCP port 8000 to get information about the status of the PostgreSQL server. Please make sure you keep this in mind in case you add any network policy, and refer to the \"Exposed Ports\" section below for a list of ports used by CloudNativePG for finer control. Network policies are beyond the scope of this document. Please refer to the \"Network policies\" section of the Kubernetes documentation for further information. Exposed Ports CloudNativePG exposes ports at operator, instance manager and operand levels, as listed in the table below: System Port number Exposing Name TLS Authentication operator 9443 webhook server webhook-server Yes Yes operator 8080 metrics metrics No No instance manager 9187 metrics metrics Optional No instance manager 8000 status status Yes No operand 5432 PostgreSQL instance postgresql Optional Yes PostgreSQL The current implementation of CloudNativePG automatically creates passwords and .pgpass files for the database owner and, only if requested by setting enableSuperuserAccess to true , for the postgres superuser. Warning enableSuperuserAccess is set to false by default to improve the security-by-default posture of the operator, fostering a microservice approach where changes to PostgreSQL are performed in a declarative way through the spec of the Cluster resource, while providing developers with full powers inside the database through the database owner user. As far as password encryption is concerned, CloudNativePG follows the default behavior of PostgreSQL: starting from PostgreSQL 14, password_encryption is by default set to scram-sha-256 , while on earlier versions it is set to md5 . Important Please refer to the \"Password authentication\" section in the PostgreSQL documentation for details. Note The operator supports toggling the enableSuperuserAccess option. When you disable it on a running cluster, the operator will ignore the content of the secret, remove it (if previously generated by the operator) and set the password of the postgres user to NULL (de facto disabling remote access through password authentication). See the \"Secrets\" section in the \"Connecting from an application\" page for more information. You can use those files to configure application access to the database. By default, every replica is automatically configured to connect in physical async streaming replication with the current primary instance, with a special user called streaming_replica . The connection between nodes is encrypted and authentication is via TLS client certificates (please refer to the \"Client TLS/SSL Connections\" page for details). By default, the operator requires TLS v1.3 connections. Currently, the operator allows administrators to add pg_hba.conf lines directly in the manifest as part of the pg_hba section of the postgresql configuration. The lines defined in the manifest are added to a default pg_hba.conf . For further detail on how pg_hba.conf is managed by the operator, see the \"PostgreSQL Configuration\" page of the documentation. The administrator can also customize the content of the pg_ident.conf file that by default only maps the local postgres user to the postgres user in the database. For further detail on how pg_ident.conf is managed by the operator, see the \"PostgreSQL Configuration\" page of the documentation. Important Examples assume that the Kubernetes cluster runs in a private and secure network. Storage CloudNativePG delegates encryption at rest to the underlying storage class. For data protection in production environments, we highly recommend that you choose a storage class that supports encryption at rest.","title":"Security"},{"location":"security/#security","text":"This section contains information about security for CloudNativePG, that are analyzed at 3 different layers: Code, Container and Cluster.

Storage must always be available, scale, perform well, and guarantee consistency and durability. The same expectations and requirements that apply to traditional environments, such as virtual machines and bare metal, are also valid in container contexts managed by Kubernetes. Important When it comes to dynamically provisioned storage, Kubernetes has its own specifics. These include storage classes , persistent volumes , and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) . You need to own these concepts, on top of all the valuable knowledge you've built over the years in terms of storage for database workloads on VMs and physical servers. There are two primary methods of access to storage: Network \u2013 Either directly or indirectly. (Think of an NFS volume locally mounted on a host running Kubernetes.) Local \u2013 Directly attached to the node where a pod is running. This also includes directly attached disks on bare metal installations of Kubernetes. Network storage, which is the most common usage pattern in Kubernetes, presents the same issues of throughput and latency that you can experience in a traditional environment. These issues can be accentuated in a shared environment, where I/O contention with several applications increases the variability of performance results. Local storage enables shared-nothing architectures, which is more suitable for high transactional and very large database (VLDB) workloads, as it guarantees higher and more predictable performance. Warning Before you deploy a PostgreSQL cluster with CloudNativePG, ensure that the storage you're using is recommended for database workloads. We recommend clearly setting performance expectations by first benchmarking the storage using tools such as fio and then the database using pgbench . Info CloudNativePG doesn't use StatefulSet for managing data persistence. Rather, it manages PVCs directly. If you want to know more, see Custom pod controller . Backup and recovery Since CloudNativePG supports volume snapshots for both backup and recovery, we recommend that you also consider this aspect when you choose your storage solution, especially if you manage very large databases. Important See the Kubernetes documentation for a list of all the supported container storage interface (CSI) drivers that provide snapshot capabilities. Benchmarking CloudNativePG Before deploying the database in production, we recommend that you benchmark CloudNativePG in a controlled Kubernetes environment. Follow the guidelines in Benchmarking . Briefly, we recommend operating at two levels: Measuring the performance of the underlying storage using fio, with relevant metrics for database workloads such as throughput for sequential reads, sequential writes, random reads, and random writes Measuring the performance of the database using pgbench, the default benchmarking tool distributed with PostgreSQL Important You must measure both the storage and database performance before putting the database into production. These results are extremely valuable not just in the planning phase (for example, capacity planning). They are also valuable in the production lifecycle, particularly in emergency situations when you don't have time to run this kind of test. Databases change and evolve over time, and so does the distribution of data, potentially affecting performance. Knowing the theoretical maximum throughput of sequential reads or writes is extremely useful in those situations. This is true especially in shared-nothing contexts, where results don't vary due to the influence of external workloads. Know your system: benchmark it. Encryption at rest Encryption at rest is possible with CloudNativePG. The operator delegates that to the underlying storage class. See the storage class for information about this important security feature. Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) The operator creates a PVC for each PostgreSQL instance, with the goal of storing the PGDATA . It then mounts it into each pod. Additionally, it supports creating clusters with: A separate PVC on which to store PostgreSQL WAL, as explained in Volume for WAL Additional separate volumes reserved for PostgreSQL tablespaces, as explained in Tablespaces In CloudNativePG, the volumes attached to a single PostgreSQL instance are defined as a PVC group . Configuration via a storage class Important CloudNativePG was designed to work interchangeably with all storage classes. As usual, we recommend properly benchmarking the storage class in a controlled environment before deploying to production. The easiest way to configure the storage for a PostgreSQL class is to request storage of a certain size, like in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: postgresql-storage-class spec: instances: 3 storage: size: 1Gi Using the previous configuration, the generated PVCs are satisfied by the default storage class. If the target Kubernetes cluster has no default storage class, or even if you need your PVCs to be satisfied by a known storage class, you can set it into the custom resource: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: postgresql-storage-class spec: instances: 3 storage: storageClass: standard size: 1Gi Configuration via a PVC template To further customize the generated PVCs, you can provide a PVC template inside the custom resource, like in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: postgresql-pvc-template spec: instances: 3 storage: pvcTemplate: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 1Gi storageClassName: standard volumeMode: Filesystem Volume for WAL By default, PostgreSQL stores all its data in the so-called PGDATA (a directory). One of the core directories inside PGDATA is pg_wal , which contains the log of transactional changes that occurred in the database, in the form of segment files. ( pg_wal is historically known as pg_xlog in PostgreSQL.) Info Normally, each segment is 16MB in size, but you can configure the size using the walSegmentSize option. This option is applied at cluster initialization time, as described in Bootstrap an empty cluster . In most cases, having pg_wal on the same volume where PGDATA resides is fine. However, having WALs stored in a separate volume has a few benefits: I/O performance \u2013 By storing WAL files on different storage from PGDATA , PostgreSQL can exploit parallel I/O for WAL operations (normally sequential writes) and for data files (tables and indexes for example), thus improving vertical scalability. More reliability \u2013 By reserving dedicated disk space to WAL files, you can be sure that exhausting space on the PGDATA volume never interferes with WAL writing. This behavior ensures that your PostgreSQL primary is correctly shut down. Finer control \u2013 You can define the amount of space dedicated to both PGDATA and pg_wal , fine tune WAL configuration and checkpoints, and even use a different storage class for cost optimization. Better I/O monitoring \u2013 You can constantly monitor the load and disk usage on both PGDATA and pg_wal . You can also set alerts that notify you in case, for example, PGDATA requires resizing. Write-Ahead Log (WAL) See Reliability and the Write-Ahead Log in the PostgreSQL documentation for more information. You can add a separate volume for WAL using the .spec.walStorage option. It follows the same rules described for the storage field and provisions a dedicated PVC. For example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: separate-pgwal-volume spec: instances: 3 storage: size: 1Gi walStorage: size: 1Gi Important Removing walStorage isn't supported. Once added, a separate volume for WALs can't be removed from an existing Postgres cluster. Volumes for tablespaces CloudNativePG supports declarative tablespaces. You can add one or more volumes, each dedicated to a single PostgreSQL tablespace. See Tablespaces for details. Volume expansion Kubernetes exposes an API allowing expanding PVCs that's enabled by default. However, it needs to be supported by the underlying StorageClass . To check if a certain StorageClass supports volume expansion, you can read the allowVolumeExpansion field for your storage class: $ kubectl get storageclass -o jsonpath='{$.allowVolumeExpansion}' premium-storage true Using the volume expansion Kubernetes feature Given the storage class supports volume expansion, you can change the size requirement of the Cluster , and the operator applies the change to every PVC. If the StorageClass supports online volume resizing , the change is immediately applied to the pods. If the underlying storage class doesn't support that, you must delete the pod to trigger the resize. The best way to proceed is to delete one pod at a time, starting from replicas and waiting for each pod to be back up. Expanding PVC volumes on AKS Currently, Azure can resize the PVC's volume without restarting the pod only on specific regions . CloudNativePG has overcome this limitation through the ENABLE_AZURE_PVC_UPDATES environment variable in the operator configuration . When set to true , CloudNativePG triggers a rolling update of the Postgres cluster. Alternatively, you can use the following workaround to manually resize the volume in AKS. Workaround for volume expansion on AKS You can manually resize a PVC on AKS. As an example, suppose you have a cluster with three replicas: $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE cluster-example-1 1/1 Running 0 2m37s cluster-example-2 1/1 Running 0 2m22s cluster-example-3 1/1 Running 0 2m10s An Azure disk can be expanded only while in \"unattached\" state, as described in the Kubernetes documentation . This means that, to resize a disk used by a PostgreSQL cluster, you need to perform a manual rollout, first cordoning the node that hosts the pod using the PVC bound to the disk. This prevents the operator from re-creating the pod and immediately reattaching it to its PVC before the background disk resizing is complete. First, edit the cluster definition, applying the new size. In this example, the new size is 2Gi . apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: cluster-example spec: instances: 3 storage: storageClass: default size: 2Gi Assuming the cluster-example-1 pod is the cluster's primary, you can proceed with the replicas first. For example, start with cordoning the Kubernetes node that hosts the cluster-example-3 pod: kubectl cordon <node of cluster-example-3> Then delete the cluster-example-3 pod: $ kubectl delete pod/cluster-example-3 Run the following command: kubectl get pvc -w -o=jsonpath='{.status.conditions[].message}' cluster-example-3 Wait until you see the following output: Waiting for user to (re-)start a Pod to finish file system resize of volume on node. Then, you can uncordon the node: kubectl uncordon <node of cluster-example-3> Wait for the pod to be re-created correctly and get in a \"Running and Ready\" state: kubectl get pods -w cluster-example-3 cluster-example-3 0/1 Init:0/1 0 12m cluster-example-3 1/1 Running 0 12m Verify the PVC expansion by running the following command, which returns 2Gi as configured: kubectl get pvc cluster-example-3 -o=jsonpath='{.status.capacity.storage}' You can repeat these steps for the remaining pods. Important Leave the resizing of the disk associated with the primary instance as the last disk, after promoting through a switchover a new resized pod, using kubectl cnpg promote . For example, use kubectl cnpg promote cluster-example 3 to promote cluster-example-3 to primary. Re-creating storage If the storage class doesn't support volume expansion, you can still regenerate your cluster on different PVCs. Allocate new PVCs with increased storage and then move the database there. This operation is feasible only when the cluster contains more than one node. While you do that, you need to prevent the operator from changing the existing PVC by disabling the resizeInUseVolumes flag, like in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: postgresql-pvc-template spec: instances: 3 storage: storageClass: standard size: 1Gi resizeInUseVolumes: False To move the entire cluster to a different storage area, you need to re-create all the PVCs and all the pods. Suppose you have a cluster with three replicas, like in the following example: $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE cluster-example-1 1/1 Running 0 2m37s cluster-example-2 1/1 Running 0 2m22s cluster-example-3 1/1 Running 0 2m10s To re-create the cluster using different PVCs, you can edit the cluster definition to disable resizeInUseVolumes . Then re-create every instance in a different PVC. For example, re-create the storage for cluster-example-3 : $ kubectl delete pvc/cluster-example-3 pod/cluster-example-3 Important If you created a dedicated WAL volume, both PVCs must be deleted during this process. The same procedure applies if you want to regenerate the WAL volume PVC. You can do this by also disabling resizeInUseVolumes for the .spec.walStorage section. For example, if a PVC dedicated to WAL storage is present: $ kubectl delete pvc/cluster-example-3 pvc/cluster-example-3-wal pod/cluster-example-3 Having done that, the operator orchestrates creating another replica with a resized PVC: $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE cluster-example-1 1/1 Running 0 5m58s cluster-example-2 1/1 Running 0 5m43s cluster-example-4-join-v2 0/1 Completed 0 17s cluster-example-4 1/1 Running 0 10s Static provisioning of persistent volumes CloudNativePG was designed to work with dynamic volume provisioning. This capability allows storage volumes to be created on demand when requested by users by way of storage classes and PVC templates. See Re-creating storage . However, in some cases, Kubernetes administrators prefer to manually create storage volumes and then create the related PersistentVolume objects for their representation inside the Kubernetes cluster. This is also known as pre-provisioning of volumes. Important We recommend that you avoid pre-provisioning volumes, as it has an effect on the high availability and self-healing capabilities of the operator. It breaks the fully declarative model on which CloudNativePG was built. To use a pre-provisioned volume in CloudNativePG: Manually create the volume outside Kubernetes. Create the PersistentVolume object to match this volume using the correct parameters as required by the actual CSI driver (that is, volumeHandle , fsType , storageClassName , and so on). Create the Postgres Cluster using, for each storage section, a coherent pvcTemplate section that can help Kubernetes match the PersistentVolume and enable CloudNativePG to create the needed PersistentVolumeClaim . Warning With static provisioning, it's your responsibility to ensure that Postgres pods can be correctly scheduled by Kubernetes where a pre-provisioned volume exists. (The scheduling configuration is based on the affinity rules of your cluster.) Make sure you check for any pods stuck in Pending after you deploy the cluster. If the condition persists, investigate why it's happening. Block storage considerations (Ceph/Longhorn) Most block storage solutions in Kubernetes, such as Longhorn and Ceph, recommend having multiple replicas of a volume to enhance resiliency. This approach works well for workloads that lack built-in resiliency. However, CloudNativePG integrates this resiliency directly into the Postgres Cluster through the number of instances and the persistent volumes attached to them, as explained in \"Synchronizing the state\" . As a result, defining additional replicas at the storage level can lead to write amplification, unnecessarily increasing disk I/O and space usage. For CloudNativePG usage, consider reducing the number of replicas at the block storage level to one, while ensuring that no single point of failure (SPoF) exists at the storage level for the entire Cluster resource. This typically means ensuring that a single storage host\u2014and ultimately, a physical disk\u2014does not host blocks from different instances of the same Cluster , in alignment with the broader shared-nothing architecture principle. In Longhorn, you can mitigate this risk by enabling strict-local data locality when creating a custom storage class. Detailed instructions for creating a volume with strict-local data locality are available here . This setting ensures that a pod\u2019s data volume resides on the same node as the pod itself. Additionally, your Postgres Cluster should have pod anti-affinity rules in place to ensure that the operator deploys pods across different nodes, allowing Longhorn to place the data volumes on the corresponding hosts. If needed, you can manually relocate volumes in Longhorn by temporarily setting the volume replica count to 2, reducing it afterward, and then removing the old replica. If a host becomes corrupted, you can use the cnpg plugin to destroy the affected instance. CloudNativePG will then recreate the instance on another host and replicate the data. In Ceph, this can be configured through CRUSH rules. The documentation for configuring CRUSH rules is available here . These rules aim to ensure one volume per pod per node. You can also relocate volumes by importing them into a different pool.","title":"Storage"},{"location":"storage/#storage","text":"Storage is the most critical component in a database workload. Storage must always be available, scale, perform well, and guarantee consistency and durability. The same expectations and requirements that apply to traditional environments, such as virtual machines and bare metal, are also valid in container contexts managed by Kubernetes. Important When it comes to dynamically provisioned storage, Kubernetes has its own specifics. These include storage classes , persistent volumes , and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) . You need to own these concepts, on top of all the valuable knowledge you've built over the years in terms of storage for database workloads on VMs and physical servers. There are two primary methods of access to storage: Network \u2013 Either directly or indirectly. (Think of an NFS volume locally mounted on a host running Kubernetes.) Local \u2013 Directly attached to the node where a pod is running. This also includes directly attached disks on bare metal installations of Kubernetes. Network storage, which is the most common usage pattern in Kubernetes, presents the same issues of throughput and latency that you can experience in a traditional environment. These issues can be accentuated in a shared environment, where I/O contention with several applications increases the variability of performance results. Local storage enables shared-nothing architectures, which is more suitable for high transactional and very large database (VLDB) workloads, as it guarantees higher and more predictable performance. Warning Before you deploy a PostgreSQL cluster with CloudNativePG, ensure that the storage you're using is recommended for database workloads. We recommend clearly setting performance expectations by first benchmarking the storage using tools such as fio and then the database using pgbench .

These results are extremely valuable not just in the planning phase (for example, capacity planning). They are also valuable in the production lifecycle, particularly in emergency situations when you don't have time to run this kind of test. Databases change and evolve over time, and so does the distribution of data, potentially affecting performance.

It offers a powerful means to enhance the vertical scalability of a database by decoupling the physical and logical modeling of data. Essentially, it serves as a technique for physical database modeling, enabling the efficient distribution of I/O operations across multiple volumes on distinct storage. It thereby optimizes performance through parallel on-disk read/write operations. In the context of the database industry, tablespaces play a strategic role, particularly when paired with table partitioning, a logical database modeling technique. They prove instrumental in managing large-scale databases and are also used for tasks such as separating tables from indexes or executing temporary operations. Tablespaces in PostgreSQL have been playing a pivotal role since 2005 (version 8.0), while declarative partitioning was introduced in 2017 (version 10). Consequently, tablespaces are seamlessly integrated into all supported releases of PostgreSQL. Quoting from the PostgreSQL documentation on tablespaces : By using tablespaces, an administrator can control the disk layout of a PostgreSQL installation. This is useful in at least two ways. First, if the partition or volume on which the cluster was initialized runs out of space and cannot be extended, a tablespace can be created on a different partition and used until the system can be reconfigured. Second, tablespaces allow an administrator to use knowledge of the usage pattern of database objects to optimize performance. Declarative tablespaces CloudNativePG provides support for PostgreSQL tablespaces through declarative tablespaces , operating at two distinct levels: Kubernetes, managing persistent volume claims, identically to how PGDATA and WAL volumes are handled PostgreSQL, managing the TABLESPACE global objects in the PostgreSQL instance Being a part of the Kubernetes ecosystem, CloudNativePG's declarative tablespaces are implemented by leveraging persistent volume claims (and persistent volumes). Each tablespace defined in the cluster is housed in its own persistent volume. CloudNativePG takes care of generating the PVCs. It mounts the required volumes in the instance pods in normalized locations and ensures replicas are ready to support tablespaces before activating them in the primary. You can set up tablespaces when creating the cluster or add them later, provided the storage is available when requested. Currently, you can't remove them. However, this limitation will be addressed in a future minor or patch version of CloudNativePG. Using declarative tablespaces Using declarative tablespaces is straightforward. You can find a full example in cluster-example-with-tablespaces.yaml . To use them, use the new tablespaces stanza on a new or existing Cluster resource: spec: instances: 3 # ... tablespaces: - name: tbs1 storage: size: 1Gi - name: tbs2 storage: size: 2Gi - name: tbs3 storage: size: 2Gi Each tablespace has its own storage section where you can configure the size and the storage class of the generated PVC. The administrator can thus plan to use different storage classes for different kinds of workloads, as explained in Storage classes and tablespaces . CloudNativePG creates the persistent volume claims for each instance in the high-availability Postgres cluster. It mounts them in each pod when they have been provisioned. Then, it ensures that the tbs1 , tbs2 , and tbs3 tablespaces are created on the primary PostgreSQL instance using the CREATE TABLESPACE command. This process is quick, and you see this reflected in Postgres: app=# SELECT oid, spcname FROM pg_tablespace; oid | spcname -------+-------------------- 1663 | pg_default 1664 | pg_global 16387 | tbs1 16388 | tbs2 16389 | tbs3 (5 rows) You can start using them right away: app=# CREATE TABLE fibonacci(num INTEGER) TABLESPACE tbs1; CREATE TABLE The cluster status has a section for tablespaces: status: <- snipped -> tablespacesStatus: - name: atablespace state: reconciled - name: another_tablespace state: reconciled - name: tablespacea1 state: reconciled Storage classes and tablespaces You can use different storage classes for your tablespaces, just as you can for PGDATA and WAL volumes. This is a convenient way of optimizing your resources, balancing performance and costs of your storage based on data access usage and expectations. This example helps to explain the feature: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: yardbirds spec: instances: 3 storage: size: 10Gi walStorage: size: 10Gi tablespaces: - name: current size: 100Gi storageClass: fastest - name: this_year size: 500Gi storageClass: balanced The yardbirds cluster example requests 4 persistent volume claims using 3 different storage classes: Default storage class \u2013 Used by the PGDATA and WAL volumes. fastest \u2013 Used by the current tablespace to store the most active and demanding set of data in the database. balanced \u2013 Used by the this_year tablespace to store older partitions of data that are rarely accessed by users and where performance expectations aren't the highest. You can then take advantage of horizontal table partitioning and create the current month's table (for example, facts for December 2023) in the current tablespace: CREATE TABLE facts_202312 PARTITION OF facts FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-12-01') TO ('2024-01-01') TABLESPACE current; Important This example assumes you're familiar with PostgreSQL declarative partitioning . Tablespace ownership By default, unless otherwise specified, tablespaces are owned by the app application user, as defined in .spec.bootstrap.initdb.owner . See Bootstrap a new cluster for details. This default behavior works in most microservice database use cases. You can set the owner of a tablespace in the owner stanza, for example the postgres user, like in the following excerpt: # ... tablespaces: - name: clapton owner: name: postgres storage: size: 1Gi Important If you change the ownership of a tablespace, make sure that you're using an existing role. Otherwise, the status of the cluster reports the issue and stops reconciling tablespaces until fixed. It's your responsibility to monitor the status and the log and to promptly intervene by fixing the issue. If you define a tablespace with an owner that doesn't exist, CloudNativePG can't create the tablespace and reflects this in the cluster status: spec: instances: 3 # ... tablespaces: - name: tbs1 storage: size: 1Gi - name: tbs2 storage: size: 2Gi - name: tbs3 owner: name: badhombre storage: size: 2Gi status: <- snipped -> tablespacesStatus: - name: tbs1 status: reconciled - name: tbs2 status: reconciled - error: 'while creating tablespace tbs3: ERROR: role \"badhombre\" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42704)' name: tbs3 status: pending Backup and recovery CloudNativePG handles backup of tablespaces (and the relative tablespace map) both on object stores and volume snapshots. Warning By default, backups are taken from replica nodes. A backup taken immediately after creating tablespaces in a cluster can result in an incomplete view of the tablespaces from the replica and thus an incomplete backup. The lag will be resolved in a maximum of 5 minutes, with the next reconciliation. Once a cluster with tablespaces has a base backup, you can restore a new cluster from it. When it comes to the recovery side, it's your responsibility to ensure that the Cluster definition of the recovered database contains the exact list of tablespaces. Replica clusters Replica clusters must have the same tablespace definition as their origin. The reason is that tablespace management commands like CREATE TABLESPACE are WAL logged and are replayed by any physical replication client (streaming or by way of WAL shipping). It's your responsibility to ensure that replica clusters have the same list of tablespaces, with the same name. Storage class and size might vary. For example: spec: # ... bootstrap: recovery: # ... your selected recovery method tablespaces: - name: tbs1 storage: size: 1Gi - name: tbs2 storage: size: 2Gi - name: tbs3 storage: size: 2Gi Temporary tablespaces PostgreSQL allows you to define one or more temporary tablespaces to create temporary objects (temporary tables and indexes on temporary tables) when a CREATE command doesn't explicitly specify a tablespace, and to create temporary files for purposes such as sorting large data sets. When no temporary tablespace is specified, PostgreSQL uses the default tablespace of a database, which is currently the main PGDATA volume. When you specify more than one temporary tablespace, PostgreSQL randomly picks one the first time a temporary object needs to be created in a transaction. Then it sequentially iterates through the list. Temporary tablespaces also work like regular tablespaces with regard to backups. CloudNativePG provides the .spec.tablespaces[*].temporary option to determine whether to add a tablespace to the temp_tablespaces PostgreSQL parameter and thus become eligible to store temporary data that doesn't have an explicit tablespace assignment. spec: [...] tablespaces: - name: atablespace storage: size: 1Gi temporary: true They can be created at initialization time or added later, requiring a rolling update. The temporary: true/false option adds or removes the tablespace name to or from the list of tablespaces in the temp_tablespaces option. This change doesn't require a restart of PostgreSQL. Although temporary tablespaces can also work as regular tablespaces (meaning that users can also host regular data on them while using them for temporary operations), we recommend that you don't mix the two workloads. See the PostgreSQL documentation on temp_tablespaces for details. kubectl plugin support The kubectl status plugin includes a section dedicated to tablespaces that offers a convenient overview, including tablespace status, owner, temporary flag, and any errors: [...] Tablespaces status Tablespace Owner Status Temporary Error ---------- ----- ------ --------- ----- atablespace app reconciled true another_tablespace app reconciled true tablespacea1 app reconciled false Instances status [...] Limitations Currently, you can't remove tablespaces from an existing CloudNativePG cluster.","title":"Tablespaces"},{"location":"tablespaces/#tablespaces","text":"A tablespace is a robust and widely embraced feature in database management systems.

Before you start Kubernetes environment What can make a difference in a troubleshooting activity is to provide clear information about the underlying Kubernetes system. Make sure you know: the Kubernetes distribution and version you are using the specifications of the nodes where PostgreSQL is running as much as you can about the actual storage , including storage class and benchmarks you have done before going into production. which relevant Kubernetes applications you are using in your cluster (i.e. Prometheus, Grafana, Istio, Certmanager, ...) the situation of continuous backup, in particular if it's in place and working correctly: in case it is not, make sure you take an emergency backup before performing any potential disrupting operation Useful utilities On top of the mandatory kubectl utility, for troubleshooting, we recommend the following plugins/utilities to be available in your system: cnpg plugin for kubectl jq , a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor grep , searches one or more input files for lines containing a match to a specified pattern. It is already available in most *nix distros. If you are on Windows OS, you can use findstr as an alternative to grep or directly use wsl and install your preferred *nix distro and use the tools mentioned above. First steps To quickly get an overview of the cluster or installation, the kubectl plugin is the primary tool to use: the status subcommand provides an overview of a cluster the report subcommand provides the manifests for clusters and the operator deployment. It can also include logs using the --logs option. The report generated via the plugin will include the full cluster manifest. The plugin can be installed on air-gapped systems via packages. Please refer to the plugin document for complete instructions. Are there backups? After getting the cluster manifest with the plugin, you should verify if backups are set up and working. In a cluster with backups set up, you will find, in the cluster Status, the fields lastSuccessfulBackup and firstRecoverabilityPoint . You should make sure there is a recent lastSuccessfulBackup . A cluster lacking the .spec.backup stanza won't have backups. An insistent message will appear in the PostgreSQL logs: Backup not configured, skip WAL archiving. Before proceeding with troubleshooting operations, it may be advisable to perform an emergency backup depending on your findings regarding backups. Refer to the following section for instructions. It is extremely risky to operate a production database without keeping regular backups. Emergency backup In some emergency situations, you might need to take an emergency logical backup of the main app database. Important The instructions you find below must be executed only in emergency situations and the temporary backup files kept under the data protection policies that are effective in your organization. The dump file is indeed stored in the client machine that runs the kubectl command, so make sure that all protections are in place and you have enough space to store the backup file. The following example shows how to take a logical backup of the app database in the cluster-example Postgres cluster, from the cluster-example-1 pod: kubectl exec cluster-example-1 -c postgres \\ -- pg_dump -Fc -d app > app.dump Note You can easily adapt the above command to backup your cluster, by providing the names of the objects you have used in your environment. The above command issues a pg_dump command in custom format, which is the most versatile way to take logical backups in PostgreSQL . The next step is to restore the database. We assume that you are operating on a new PostgreSQL cluster that's been just initialized (so the app database is empty). The following example shows how to restore the above logical backup in the app database of the new-cluster-example Postgres cluster, by connecting to the primary ( new-cluster-example-1 pod): kubectl exec -i new-cluster-example-1 -c postgres \\ -- pg_restore --no-owner --role=app -d app --verbose < app.dump Important The example in this section assumes that you have no other global objects (databases and roles) to dump and restore, as per our recommendation. In case you have multiple roles, make sure you have taken a backup using pg_dumpall -g and you manually restore them in the new cluster. In case you have multiple databases, you need to repeat the above operation one database at a time, making sure you assign the right ownership. If you are not familiar with PostgreSQL, we advise that you do these critical operations under the guidance of a professional support company. The above steps might be integrated into the cnpg plugin at some stage in the future. Logs All resources created and managed by CloudNativePG log to standard output in accordance with Kubernetes conventions, using JSON format . While logs are typically processed at the infrastructure level and include those from CloudNativePG, accessing logs directly from the command line interface is critical during troubleshooting. You have three primary options for doing so: Use the kubectl logs command to retrieve logs from a specific resource, and apply jq for better readability. Use the kubectl cnpg logs command for CloudNativePG-specific logging. Leverage specialized open-source tools like stern , which can aggregate logs from multiple resources (e.g., all pods in a PostgreSQL cluster by selecting the cnpg.io/clusterName label), filter log entries, customize output formats, and more. Note The following sections provide examples of how to retrieve logs for various resources when troubleshooting CloudNativePG. Operator information By default, the CloudNativePG operator is installed in the cnpg-system namespace in Kubernetes as a Deployment (see the \"Details about the deployment\" section for details). You can get a list of the operator pods by running: kubectl get pods -n cnpg-system Note Under normal circumstances, you should have one pod where the operator is running, identified by a name starting with cnpg-controller-manager- . In case you have set up your operator for high availability, you should have more entries. Those pods are managed by a deployment named cnpg-controller-manager . Collect the relevant information about the operator that is running in pod <POD> with: kubectl describe pod -n cnpg-system <POD> Then get the logs from the same pod by running: kubectl logs -n cnpg-system <POD> Gather more information about the operator Get logs from all pods in CloudNativePG operator Deployment (in case you have a multi operator deployment) by running: kubectl logs -n cnpg-system \\ deployment/cnpg-controller-manager --all-containers=true Tip You can add -f flag to above command to follow logs in real time.

Node information Kubernetes nodes is where ultimately PostgreSQL pods will be running. It's strategically important to know as much as we can about them. You can get the list of nodes in your Kubernetes cluster with: # look at the worker nodes and their status kubectl get nodes -o wide Additionally, you can gather the list of nodes where the pods of a given cluster are running with: kubectl get pod -l cnpg.io/cluster=<CLUSTER> \\ -L role -n <NAMESPACE> -o wide The latter is important to understand where your pods are distributed - very useful if you are using affinity/anti-affinity rules and/or tolerations . Conditions Like many native kubernetes objects like here , Cluster exposes status.conditions as well. This allows one to 'wait' for a particular event to occur instead of relying on the overall cluster health state. Available conditions as of now are: LastBackupSucceeded ContinuousArchiving Ready LastBackupSucceeded is reporting the status of the latest backup. If set to True the last backup has been taken correctly, it is set to False otherwise. ContinuousArchiving is reporting the status of the WAL archiving. If set to True the last WAL archival process has been terminated correctly, it is set to False otherwise. Ready is True when the cluster has the number of instances specified by the user and the primary instance is ready. This condition can be used in scripts to wait for the cluster to be created. How to wait for a particular condition Backup: $ kubectl wait --for=condition=LastBackupSucceeded cluster/<CLUSTER-NAME> -n <NAMESPACE> ContinuousArchiving: $ kubectl wait --for=condition=ContinuousArchiving cluster/<CLUSTER-NAME> -n <NAMESPACE> Ready (Cluster is ready or not): $ kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready cluster/<CLUSTER-NAME> -n <NAMESPACE> Below is a snippet of a cluster.status that contains a failing condition. $ kubectl get cluster/<cluster-name> -o yaml . . . status: conditions: - message: 'unexpected failure invoking barman-cloud-wal-archive: exit status 2' reason: ContinuousArchivingFailing status: \"False\" type: ContinuousArchiving - message: exit status 2 reason: LastBackupFailed status: \"False\" type: LastBackupSucceeded - message: Cluster Is Not Ready reason: ClusterIsNotReady status: \"False\" type: Ready Networking CloudNativePG requires basic networking and connectivity in place. You can find more information in the networking section. If installing CloudNativePG in an existing environment, there might be network policies in place, or other network configuration made specifically for the cluster, which could have an impact on the required connectivity between the operator and the cluster pods and/or the between the pods. You can look for existing network policies with the following command: kubectl get networkpolicies There might be several network policies set up by the Kubernetes network administrator. $ kubectl get networkpolicies NAME POD-SELECTOR AGE allow-prometheus cnpg.io/cluster=cluster-example 47m default-deny-ingress <none> 57m PostgreSQL core dumps Although rare, PostgreSQL can sometimes crash and generate a core dump in the PGDATA folder. When that happens, normally it is a bug in PostgreSQL (and most likely it has already been solved - this is why it is important to always run the latest minor version of PostgreSQL). CloudNativePG allows you to control what to include in the core dump through the cnpg.io/coredumpFilter annotation. Info Please refer to \"Labels and annotations\" for more details on the standard annotations that CloudNativePG provides. By default, the cnpg.io/coredumpFilter is set to 0x31 in order to exclude shared memory segments from the dump, as this is the safest approach in most cases. Info Please refer to \"Core dump filtering settings\" section of \"The /proc Filesystem\" page of the Linux Kernel documentation . for more details on how to set the bitmask that controls the core dump filter. Important Beware that this setting only takes effect during Pod startup and that changing the annotation doesn't trigger an automated rollout of the instances. Although you might not personally be involved in inspecting core dumps, you might be asked to provide them so that a Postgres expert can look into them. First, verify that you have a core dump in the PGDATA directory with the following command (please run it against the correct pod where the Postgres instance is running): kubectl exec -ti POD -c postgres \\ -- find /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata -name 'core.*' Under normal circumstances, this should return an empty set. Suppose, for example, that we have a core dump file: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata/core.14177 Once you have verified the space on disk is sufficient, you can collect the core dump on your machine through kubectl cp as follows: kubectl cp POD:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata/core.14177 core.14177 You now have the file. Make sure you free the space on the server by removing the core dumps. Some known issues Storage is full In case the storage is full, the PostgreSQL pods will not be able to write new data, or, in case of the disk containing the WAL segments being full, PostgreSQL will shut down. If you see messages in the logs about the disk being full, you should increase the size of the affected PVC. You can do this by editing the PVC and changing the spec.resources.requests.storage field. After that, you should also update the Cluster resource with the new size to apply the same change to all the pods. Please look at the \"Volume expansion\" section in the documentation. If the space for WAL segments is exhausted, the pod will be crash-looping and the cluster status will report Not enough disk space . Increasing the size in the PVC and then in the Cluster resource will solve the issue. See also the \"Disk Full Failure\" section Pods are stuck in Pending state In case a Cluster's instance is stuck in the Pending phase, you should check the pod's Events section to get an idea of the reasons behind this: kubectl describe pod -n <NAMESPACE> <POD> Some of the possible causes for this are: No nodes are matching the nodeSelector Tolerations are not correctly configured to match the nodes' taints No nodes are available at all: this could also be related to cluster-autoscaler hitting some limits, or having some temporary issues In this case, it could also be useful to check events in the namespace: kubectl get events -n <NAMESPACE> # list events in chronological order kubectl get events -n <NAMESPACE> --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp Replicas out of sync when no backup is configured Sometimes replicas might be switched off for a bit of time due to maintenance reasons (think of when a Kubernetes nodes is drained). In case your cluster does not have backup configured, when replicas come back up, they might require a WAL file that is not present anymore on the primary (having been already recycled according to the WAL management policies as mentioned in \"The postgresql section\" ), and fall out of synchronization. Similarly, when pg_rewind might require a WAL file that is not present anymore in the former primary, reporting pg_rewind: error: could not open file . In these cases, pods cannot become ready anymore, and you are required to delete the PVC and let the operator rebuild the replica. If you rely on dynamically provisioned Persistent Volumes, and you are confident in deleting the PV itself, you can do so with: PODNAME=<POD> VOLNAME=$(kubectl get pv -o json | \\ jq -r '.items[]|select(.spec.claimRef.name=='\\\"$PODNAME\\\"')|.metadata.name') kubectl delete pod/$PODNAME pvc/$PODNAME pvc/$PODNAME-wal pv/$VOLNAME Cluster stuck in Creating new replica Cluster is stuck in \"Creating a new replica\", while pod logs don't show relevant problems. This has been found to be related to the next issue on connectivity . Networking issues are reflected in the status column as follows: Instance Status Extraction Error: HTTP communication issue Networking is impaired by installed Network Policies As pointed out in the networking section , local network policies could prevent some of the required connectivity. A tell-tale sign that connectivity is impaired is the presence in the operator logs of messages like: \"Cannot extract Pod status\", [\u2026snipped\u2026] \"Get \\\"http://<pod IP>:8000/pg/status\\\": dial tcp <pod IP>:8000: i/o timeout\" You should list the network policies, and look for any policies restricting connectivity. $ kubectl get networkpolicies NAME POD-SELECTOR AGE allow-prometheus cnpg.io/cluster=cluster-example 47m default-deny-ingress <none> 57m For example, in the listing above, default-deny-ingress seems a likely culprit. You can drill into it: $ kubectl get networkpolicies default-deny-ingress -o yaml <\u2026snipped\u2026> spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Ingress In the networking page you can find a network policy file that you can customize to create a NetworkPolicy explicitly allowing the operator to connect cross-namespace to cluster pods. Error while bootstrapping the data directory If your Cluster's initialization job crashes with a \"Bus error (core dumped) child process exited with exit code 135\", you likely need to fix the Cluster hugepages settings. The reason is the incomplete support of hugepages in the cgroup v1 that should be fixed in v2. For more information, check the PostgreSQL BUG #17757: Not honoring huge_pages setting during initdb causes DB crash in Kubernetes . To check whether hugepages are enabled, run grep HugePages /proc/meminfo on the Kubernetes node and check if hugepages are present, their size, and how many are free. If the hugepages are present, you need to configure how much hugepages memory every PostgreSQL pod should have available. For example: postgresql: parameters: shared_buffers: \"128MB\" resources: requests: memory: \"512Mi\" limits: hugepages-2Mi: \"512Mi\" Please remember that you must have enough hugepages memory available to schedule every Pod in the Cluster (in the example above, at least 512MiB per Pod must be free). Bootstrap job hangs in running status If your Cluster's initialization job hangs while in Running status with the message: \"error while waiting for the API server to be reachable\", you probably have a network issue preventing communication with the Kubernetes API server. Initialization jobs (like most of jobs) need to access the Kubernetes API. Please check your networking. Another possible cause is when you have sidecar injection configured. Sidecars such as Istio may make the network temporarily unavailable during startup. If you have sidecar injection enabled, retry with injection disabled. Replicas take over two minutes to reconnect after a failover When the primary instance fails, the operator promotes the most advanced standby to the primary role. Other standby instances then attempt to reconnect to the -rw service for replication. However, during this reconnection process, kube-proxy may not have updated its routing information yet. As a result, the initial SYN packet sent by the standby instances might fail to reach its intended destination. If the network is configured to silently drop packets instead of rejecting them, standby instances will not receive a response and will retry the connection after an exponential backoff period. On Linux systems, the default value for the tcp_syn_retries kernel parameter is 6, meaning the system will attempt to establish the connection for approximately 127 seconds before giving up. This prolonged retry period can significantly delay the reconnection process. For more details, consult the tcp_syn_retries documentation . You can work around this issue by setting STANDBY_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT in the operator configuration . This will cause the standby instances to close the TCP connection if the initial SYN packet is not acknowledged within the specified timeout, allowing them to retry the connection more quickly.","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#troubleshooting","text":"In this page, you can find some basic information on how to troubleshoot CloudNativePG in your Kubernetes cluster deployment.

Info Please refer to \"Labels and annotations\" for more details on the standard annotations that CloudNativePG provides.

If the network is configured to silently drop packets instead of rejecting them, standby instances will not receive a response and will retry the connection after an exponential backoff period. On Linux systems, the default value for the tcp_syn_retries kernel parameter is 6, meaning the system will attempt to establish the connection for approximately 127 seconds before giving up. This prolonged retry period can significantly delay the reconnection process. For more details, consult the tcp_syn_retries documentation .

You can store the backup files in any service that is supported by the Barman Cloud infrastructure. That is: Amazon S3 Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Google Cloud Storage You can also use any compatible implementation of the supported services. The required setup depends on the chosen storage provider and is discussed in the following sections. AWS S3 AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) is a very popular object storage service offered by Amazon. As far as CloudNativePG backup is concerned, you can define the permissions to store backups in S3 buckets in two ways: If CloudNativePG is running in EKS. you may want to use the IRSA authentication method Alternatively, you can use the ACCESS_KEY_ID and ACCESS_SECRET_KEY credentials AWS Access key You will need the following information about your environment: ACCESS_KEY_ID : the ID of the access key that will be used to upload files into S3 ACCESS_SECRET_KEY : the secret part of the access key mentioned above ACCESS_SESSION_TOKEN : the optional session token, in case it is required The access key used must have permission to upload files into the bucket. Given that, you must create a Kubernetes secret with the credentials, and you can do that with the following command: kubectl create secret generic aws-creds \\ --from-literal=ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access key here> \\ --from-literal=ACCESS_SECRET_KEY=<secret key here> # --from-literal=ACCESS_SESSION_TOKEN=<session token here> # if required The credentials will be stored inside Kubernetes and will be encrypted if encryption at rest is configured in your installation. Once that secret has been created, you can configure your cluster like in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: \"<destination path here>\" s3Credentials: accessKeyId: name: aws-creds key: ACCESS_KEY_ID secretAccessKey: name: aws-creds key: ACCESS_SECRET_KEY The destination path can be any URL pointing to a folder where the instance can upload the WAL files, e.g. s3://BUCKET_NAME/path/to/folder . IAM Role for Service Account (IRSA) In order to use IRSA you need to set an annotation in the ServiceAccount of the Postgres cluster. We can configure CloudNativePG to inject them using the serviceAccountTemplate stanza: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: [...] spec: serviceAccountTemplate: metadata: annotations: eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:[...] [...] S3 lifecycle policy Barman Cloud writes objects to S3, then does not update them until they are deleted by the Barman Cloud retention policy. A recommended approach for an S3 lifecycle policy is to expire the current version of objects a few days longer than the Barman retention policy, enable object versioning, and expire non-current versions after a number of days. Such a policy protects against accidental deletion, and also allows for restricting permissions to the CloudNativePG workload so that it may delete objects from S3 without granting permissions to permanently delete objects. Other S3-compatible Object Storages providers In case you're using S3-compatible object storage, like MinIO or Linode Object Storage , you can specify an endpoint instead of using the default S3 one. In this example, it will use the bucket of Linode in the region us-east1 . apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: \"s3://bucket/\" endpointURL: \"https://us-east1.linodeobjects.com\" s3Credentials: [...] In case you're using Digital Ocean Spaces , you will have to use the Path-style syntax. In this example, it will use the bucket from Digital Ocean Spaces in the region SFO3 . apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: \"s3://[your-bucket-name]/[your-backup-folder]/\" endpointURL: \"https://sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com\" s3Credentials: [...] Using Object Storage with a private CA Suppose you configure an Object Storage provider which uses a certificate signed with a private CA, for example when using MinIO via HTTPS. In that case, you need to set the option endpointCA inside barmanObjectStore referring to a secret containing the CA bundle, so that Barman can verify the certificate correctly. You can find instructions on creating a secret using your cert files in the certificates document. Once you have created the secret, you can populate the endpointCA as in the following example: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: [...] backup: barmanObjectStore: endpointURL: <myEndpointURL> endpointCA: name: my-ca-secret key: ca.crt Note If you want ConfigMaps and Secrets to be automatically reloaded by instances, you can add a label with key cnpg.io/reload to the Secrets/ConfigMaps. Otherwise, you will have to reload the instances using the kubectl cnpg reload subcommand. Azure Blob Storage Azure Blob Storage is the object storage service provided by Microsoft. In order to access your storage account for backup and recovery of CloudNativePG managed databases, you will need one of the following combinations of credentials: Connection String Storage account name and Storage account access key Storage account name and Storage account SAS Token Storage account name and Azure AD Workload Identity properly configured. Using Azure AD Workload Identity , you can avoid saving the credentials into a Kubernetes Secret, and have a Cluster configuration adding the inheritFromAzureAD as follows: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: \"<destination path here>\" azureCredentials: inheritFromAzureAD: true On the other side, using both Storage account access key or Storage account SAS Token , the credentials need to be stored inside a Kubernetes Secret, adding data entries only when needed. The following command performs that: kubectl create secret generic azure-creds \\ --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=<storage account name> \\ --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_KEY=<storage account key> \\ --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN=<SAS token> \\ --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=<connection string> The credentials will be encrypted at rest, if this feature is enabled in the used Kubernetes cluster. Given the previous secret, the provided credentials can be injected inside the cluster configuration: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: \"<destination path here>\" azureCredentials: connectionString: name: azure-creds key: AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING storageAccount: name: azure-creds key: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT storageKey: name: azure-creds key: AZURE_STORAGE_KEY storageSasToken: name: azure-creds key: AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN When using the Azure Blob Storage, the destinationPath fulfills the following structure: <http|https>://<account-name>.<service-name>.core.windows.net/<resource-path> where <resource-path> is <container>/<blob> . The account name , which is also called storage account name , is included in the used host name. Other Azure Blob Storage compatible providers If you are using a different implementation of the Azure Blob Storage APIs, the destinationPath will have the following structure: <http|https>://<local-machine-address>:<port>/<account-name>/<resource-path> In that case, <account-name> is the first component of the path. This is required if you are testing the Azure support via the Azure Storage Emulator or Azurite . Google Cloud Storage Currently, the CloudNativePG operator supports two authentication methods for Google Cloud Storage : the first one assumes that the pod is running inside a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster the second one leverages the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS Running inside Google Kubernetes Engine When running inside Google Kubernetes Engine you can configure your backups to simply rely on Workload Identity , without having to set any credentials. In particular, you need to: set .spec.backup.barmanObjectStore.googleCredentials.gkeEnvironment to true set the iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account annotation in the serviceAccountTemplate stanza Please use the following example as a reference: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: [...] backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: \"gs://<destination path here>\" googleCredentials: gkeEnvironment: true serviceAccountTemplate: metadata: annotations: iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: [...].iam.gserviceaccount.com [...] Using authentication Following the instruction from Google you will get a JSON file that contains all the required information to authenticate. The content of the JSON file must be provided using a Secret that can be created with the following command: kubectl create secret generic backup-creds --from-file=gcsCredentials=gcs_credentials_file.json This will create the Secret with the name backup-creds to be used in the yaml file like this: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: \"gs://<destination path here>\" googleCredentials: applicationCredentials: name: backup-creds key: gcsCredentials Now the operator will use the credentials to authenticate against Google Cloud Storage. Important This way of authentication will create a JSON file inside the container with all the needed information to access your Google Cloud Storage bucket, meaning that if someone gets access to the pod will also have write permissions to the bucket. MinIO Gateway Optionally, you can use MinIO Gateway as a common interface which relays backup objects to other cloud storage solutions, like S3 or GCS. For more information, please refer to MinIO official documentation . Specifically, the CloudNativePG cluster can directly point to a local MinIO Gateway as an endpoint, using previously created credentials and service. MinIO secrets will be used by both the PostgreSQL cluster and the MinIO instance. Therefore, you must create them in the same namespace: kubectl create secret generic minio-creds \\ --from-literal=MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=<minio access key here> \\ --from-literal=MINIO_SECRET_KEY=<minio secret key here> Note Cloud Object Storage credentials will be used only by MinIO Gateway in this case. Important In order to allow PostgreSQL to reach MinIO Gateway, it is necessary to create a ClusterIP service on port 9000 bound to the MinIO Gateway instance. For example: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: minio-gateway-service spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - port: 9000 targetPort: 9000 protocol: TCP selector: app: minio Warning At the time of writing this documentation, the official MinIO Operator for Kubernetes does not support the gateway feature. As such, we will use a deployment instead. The MinIO deployment will use cloud storage credentials to upload objects to the remote bucket and relay backup files to different locations. Here is an example using AWS S3 as Cloud Object Storage: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment [...] spec: containers: - name: minio image: minio/minio:RELEASE.2020-06-03T22-13-49Z args: - gateway - s3 env: # MinIO access key and secret key - name: MINIO_ACCESS_KEY valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: minio-creds key: MINIO_ACCESS_KEY - name: MINIO_SECRET_KEY valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: minio-creds key: MINIO_SECRET_KEY # AWS credentials - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: aws-creds key: ACCESS_KEY_ID - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: aws-creds key: ACCESS_SECRET_KEY # Uncomment the below section if session token is required # - name: AWS_SESSION_TOKEN # valueFrom: # secretKeyRef: # name: aws-creds # key: ACCESS_SESSION_TOKEN ports: - containerPort: 9000 Proceed by configuring MinIO Gateway service as the endpointURL in the Cluster definition, then choose a bucket name to replace BUCKET_NAME : apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster [...] spec: backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://BUCKET_NAME/ endpointURL: http://minio-gateway-service:9000 s3Credentials: accessKeyId: name: minio-creds key: MINIO_ACCESS_KEY secretAccessKey: name: minio-creds key: MINIO_SECRET_KEY [...] Verify on s3://BUCKET_NAME/ the presence of archived WAL files before proceeding with a backup.","title":"Appendix A - Common object stores for backups"},{"location":"appendixes/object_stores/#appendix-a-common-object-stores-for-backups","text":"Warning With the deprecation of native Barman Cloud support in CloudNativePG in favor of the Barman Cloud Plugin, this page\u2014and the backup and recovery documentation\u2014may undergo changes before the official release of version 1.26.0.

Version 1.14.0 Release date: 25 March 2022 Features: Natively support Google Cloud Storage for backup and recovery, by taking advantage of the features introduced in Barman Cloud 2.19 Improved observability of backups through the introduction of the LastBackupSucceeded condition for the Cluster object Support update of Hot Standby sensitive parameters: max_connections , max_prepared_transactions , max_locks_per_transaction , max_wal_senders , max_worker_processes Add the Online upgrade in progress phase in the Cluster object to show when an online upgrade of the operator is in progress Ability to inherit an AWS IAM Role as an alternative way to provide credentials for the S3 object storage Support for Opaque secrets for Pooler\u2019s authQuerySecret and certificates Updated default PostgreSQL version to 14.2 Add a new command to kubectl cnp plugin named maintenance to set maintenance window to cluster(s) in one or all namespaces across the Kubernetes cluster Container Images: Latest PostgreSQL containers include Barman Cloud 2.19 Security Enhancements: Stronger RBAC enforcement for namespaced operator installations with Operator Lifecycle Manager, including OpenShift. OpenShift users are recommended to update to this version. Fixes: Allow the instance manager to retry an interrupted pg_rewind by preserving a copy of the original pg_control file Clean up stale PID files before running pg_rewind Force sorting by key in primary_conninfo to avoid random restarts with PostgreSQL versions prior to 13 Preserve ServiceAccount changes (e.g., labels, annotations) upon reconciliation Disable enforcement of the imagePullPolicy default value Improve initDB validation for WAL segment size Properly handle the targetLSN option when recovering a cluster with the LSN specified Fix custom TLS certificates validation by allowing a certificates chain both in the server and CA certificates Version 1.13.0 Release date: 17 February 2022 Features: Support for Snappy compression. Snappy is a fast compression option for backups that increase the speed of uploads to the object store using a lower compression ratio Support for tagging files uploaded to the Barman object store.

This change sets a limit on the time the operator waits for a pod to report its status before declaring it as failed, enhancing the robustness and predictability of a failover operation Introduce the .spec.inheritedMetadata field to the Cluster allowing the user to specify labels and annotations that will apply to all objects generated by the Cluster Reduce the number of queries executed when calculating the status of an instance Add a readiness probe for PgBouncer Add support for custom Certification Authority of the endpoint of Barman\u2019s backup object store when using Azure protocol Fixes: During a failover, wait to select a new primary until all the WAL streaming connections are closed. The operator now sets by default wal_sender_timeout and wal_receiver_timeout to 5 seconds to make sure standby nodes will quickly notice if the primary has network issues Change WAL archiving strategy in replica clusters to fix rolling updates by setting \"archive_mode\" to \"always\" for any PostgreSQL instance in a replica cluster. We then restrict the upload of the WAL only from the current and target designated primary. A WAL may be uploaded twice during switchovers, which is not an issue Fix support for custom Certification Authority of the endpoint of Barman\u2019s backup object store in replica clusters source Use a fixed name for default monitoring config map in the cluster namespace If the defaulting webhook is not working for any reason, the operator now updates the Cluster with the defaults also during the reconciliation cycle Fix the comparison of resource requests and limits to fix a rare issue leading to an update of all the pods on every reconciliation cycle Improve log messages from webhooks to also include the object namespace Stop logging a \u201cdefault\u201d message at the start of every reconciliation loop Stop logging a PodMonitor deletion on every reconciliation cycle if enablePodMonitor is false Do not complain about possible architecture mismatch if a pod is not reachable Version 1.11.0 Release date: 15 December 2021 Features: Parallel WAL archiving and restore: allow the database to keep up with WAL generation on high write systems by introducing the backupObjectStore.maxParallel option to set the maximum number of parallel jobs to be executed during both WAL archiving (by PostgreSQL\u2019s archive_command ) and WAL restore (by restore_command ). Using parallel restore option can allow newly promoted Standbys to get to a ready state faster by fetching needed WAL files to replay in parallel rather than sequentially Default set of metrics for monitoring: a new ConfigMap called default-monitoring is automatically deployed in the same namespace of the operator and, by default, added to any existing Postgres cluster. Such behavior can be changed globally by setting the MONITORING_QUERIES_CONFIGMAP parameter in the operator\u2019s configuration, or at cluster level through the .spec.monitoring.disableDefaultQueries option (by default set to false ) Introduce the enablePodMonitor option in the monitoring section of a cluster to automatically manage a PodMonitor resource and seamlessly integrate with Prometheus Improve the PostgreSQL shutdown procedure by trying to execute a smart shutdown for the first half of the desired stopDelay time, and a fast shutdown for the remaining half, before the pod is killed by Kubernetes Add the switchoverDelay option to control the time given to the former primary to shut down gracefully and archive all the WAL files before promoting the new primary (by default, CloudNativePG waits indefinitely to privilege data durability) Handle changes to resource requests and limits for a PostgreSQL Cluster by issuing a rolling update Improve the status command of the cnp plugin for kubectl with additional information: streaming replication status, total size of the database, role of an instance in the cluster Enhance support of workloads with many parallel workers by enabling configuration of the dynamic_shared_memory_type and shared_memory_type parameters for PostgreSQL\u2019s management of shared memory Propagate labels and annotations defined at cluster level to the associated resources, including pods (deletions are not supported) Automatically remove pods that have been evicted by the Kubelet Manage automated resizing of persistent volumes in Azure through the ENABLE_AZURE_PVC_UPDATES operator configuration option, by issuing a rolling update of the cluster if needed (disabled by default) Introduce the cnpg.io/reconciliationLoop annotation that, when set to disabled on a given Postgres cluster, prevents the reconciliation loop from running Introduce the postInitApplicationSQL option as part of the initdb bootstrap method to specify a list of SQL queries to be executed on the main application database as a superuser immediately after the cluster has been created Fixes: Liveness probe now correctly handles the startup process of a PostgreSQL server. This fixes an issue reported by a few customers and affects a restarted standby server that needs to recover WAL files to reach a consistent state, but it was not able to do it before the timeout of liveness probe would kick in, leaving the pods in CrashLoopBackOff status. Liveness probe now correctly handles the case of a former primary that needs to use pg_rewind to re-align with the current primary after a timeline diversion. This fixes the pod of the new standby from repeatedly being killed by Kubernetes. Reduce client-side throttling from Postgres pods (e.g. Waited for 1.182388649s due to client-side throttling, not priority and fairness, request: GET ) Disable Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) initialization on OpenShift and OLM installations, by using the provided one When changing configuration parameters that require a restart, always leave the primary as last Mark a PVC to be ready only after a job has been completed successfully, preventing a race condition in PVC initialization Use the correct public key when renewing the expired webhook TLS secret. Fix an overflow when parsing an LSN Remove stale PID files at startup Let the Pooler resource inherit the imagePullSecret defined in the operator, if exists Version 1.10.0 Release date: 11 November 2021 Features: Connection Pooling with PgBouncer : introduce the Pooler resource and controller to automatically manage a PgBouncer deployment to be used as a connection pooler for a local PostgreSQL Cluster . The feature includes TLS client/server connections, password authentication, High Availability, pod templates support, configuration of key PgBouncer parameters, PAUSE / RESUME , logging in JSON format, Prometheus exporter for stats, pools, and lists Backup Retention Policies : support definition of recovery window retention policies for backups (e.g. \u201830d\u2019 to ensure a recovery window of 30 days) In-Place updates of the operator : introduce an in-place online update of the instance manager, which removes the need to perform a rolling update of the entire cluster following an update of the operator.

For a complete list of changes, please refer to the commits on the release branch in GitHub. Version 1.24.3 Release Date: February 28, 2025 Enhancements Introduced a startup probe for the operator to enhance reliability and prevent premature liveness probe failures during initialization. (#7008) Added support for using the -r service with the Pooler. (#6868) Introduced an optional --ttl flag for the pgbench plugin, enabling automatic deletion of completed jobs after a user-defined duration. (#6701) Marked known error messages from the Azure CSI Driver for volume snapshots as retryable, improving resilience. (#6906) Updated the default PostgreSQL version to 17.4 for new cluster definitions. (#6960) Security The operator image build process has been enhanced to strengthen security and transparency. Images are now signed with cosign , and OCI attestations are generated, incorporating the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and provenance data. Additionally, OCI annotations have been added to improve traceability and ensure the integrity of the images. Bug Fixes Fixed inconsistent behavior in default probe knob values when .spec.probes is defined, ensuring users can override all settings, including failureThreshold . If unspecified in the startup probe, failureThreshold is now correctly derived from .spec.startupDelay / periodSeconds (default: 10 , now overridable). The same logic applies to liveness probes via .spec.livenessProbeTimeout . (#6656) Managed service ports now take precedence over default operator-defined ports. (#6474) Fixed an issue where WAL metrics were unavailable after an instance restart until a configuration change was applied. (#6816) Fixed an issue in monolithic database import where role import was skipped if no roles were specified. (#6646) Added support for new metrics introduced in PgBouncer 1.24. (#6630) Improved handling of replication-sensitive parameter reductions by ensuring timely reconciliation after primary server restarts. (#6440) Introduced a new isWALArchiver flag in the CNPG-I plugin configuration, allowing users to designate a plugin as a WAL archiver. This enables seamless migration from in-tree Barman Cloud support to the plugin while maintaining WAL archive consistency. (#6593) Ensured override.conf is consistently included in postgresql.conf during replica cluster bootstrapping, preventing replication failures due to missing configuration settings. (#6808) Ensured override.conf is correctly initialized before invoking pg_rewind to prevent failures during primary role changes.

(#6153) Bug Fixes Ensure the former primary flushes its WAL file queue to the archive before re-synchronizing as a replica, reducing recovery times and enhancing data consistency during failovers. (#6141) Clean the WAL volume along with the PGDATA volume during bootstrap. (#6265) Update the operator to set the cluster phase to Unrecoverable when all previously generated PersistentVolumeClaims are missing. (#6170) Fix the parsing of the synchronous_standby_names GUC when .spec.postgresql.synchronous.method is set to first . (#5955) Resolved a potential race condition when patching certain conditions in CRD statuses, improving reliability in concurrent updates. (#6328) Correct role changes to apply at the transaction level instead of the database context. (#6064) Remove the primary_slot_name definition from the override.conf file on the primary to ensure it is always empty. (#6219) Configure libpq environment variables, including PGHOST , in PgBouncer pods to enable seamless access to the pgbouncer virtual database using psql from within the container. (#6247) Remove unnecessary updates to the Cluster status when verifying changes in the image catalog. (#6277) Prevent panic during recovery from an external server without proper backup configuration. (#6300) Resolved a key collision issue in structured logs, where the name field was inconsistently used to log two distinct values.

(#5998) Version 1.24.1 Release date: Oct 16, 2024 Enhancements: Remove the use of pg_database_size from the status probe, as it caused high resource utilization by scanning the entire PGDATA directory to compute database sizes. The kubectl status plugin will now rely on du to provide detailed size information retrieval (#5689). Add the ability to configure the full_page_writes parameter in PostgreSQL. This setting defaults to on , in line with PostgreSQL's recommendations (#5516). Plugin: Add the logs pretty command in the cnpg plugin to read a log stream from standard input and output a human-readable format, with options to filter log entries (#5770) Enhance the status command by allowing multiple -v options to increase verbosity for more detailed output (#5765). Add support for specifying a custom Docker image using the --image flag in the pgadmin4 plugin command, giving users control over the Docker image used for pgAdmin4 deployments (#5515). Fixes: Resolve an issue with concurrent status updates when demoting a primary to a designated primary, ensuring smoother transitions during cluster role changes (#5755). Ensure that replica PodDisruptionBudgets (PDB) are removed when scaling down to two instances, enabling easier maintenance on the node hosting the replica (#5487). Prioritize full rollout over inplace restarts (#5407). When using .spec.postgresql.synchronous , ensure that the synchronous_standby_names parameter is correctly set, even when no replicas are reachable (#5831). Fix an issue that could lead to double failover in cases of lost connectivity (#5788). Correctly set the TMPDIR and PSQL_HISTORY environment variables for pods and jobs, improving temporary file and history management (#5503). Plugin: Resolve a race condition in the logs cluster command (#5775). Display the potential sync status in the status plugin (#5533). Fix the issue where pods deployed by the pgadmin4 command didn\u2019t have a writable home directory (#5800). Supported versions PostgreSQL 17 (PostgreSQL 17.0 is the default image) Version 1.24.0 Release date: Aug 22, 2024 Important changes: Deprecate the role label in the selectors of Service and PodDisruptionBudget resources in favor of cnpg.io/instanceRole (#4897). Fix the default PodAntiAffinity configuration for PostgreSQL Pods, allowing a PostgreSQL and a Pooler Instance to coexist on the same node when the anti-affinity configuration is set to required (#5156). Warning The PodAntiAffinity change will trigger a rollout of all the instances when the operator is upgraded, even when online upgrades are enabled. Features: Distributed PostgreSQL Topologies : Enhance the replica cluster feature to create distributed database topologies for PostgreSQL that span multiple Kubernetes clusters, enabling hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. This feature supports: Declarative Primary Control : Easily specify which PostgreSQL cluster acts as the primary in a distributed setup (#4388). Seamless Switchover : Effortlessly demote the current primary and promote a selected replica cluster, typically in a different region, without needing to rebuild the former primary. This ensures high availability and resilience in diverse environments (#4411). Managed Services : Introduce managed services via the managed.services stanza (#4769 and #4952), allowing you to: Disable the read-only and read services via configuration. Leverage the service template capability to create custom service resources, including load balancers, to access PostgreSQL outside Kubernetes (particularly useful for DBaaS purposes). Enhanced API for Synchronous Replication : Introducing an improved API for explicit configuration of synchronous replication, supporting both quorum-based and priority list strategies. This update allows full customization of the synchronous_standby_names option, providing greater control and flexibility (#5148). WAL Disk Space Exhaustion : Safely stop the cluster when PostgreSQL runs out of disk space to store WAL files, making recovery easier by increasing the size of the related volume (#4404). Enhancements: Add support for delayed replicas by introducing the .spec.replica.minApplyDelay option, leveraging PostgreSQL's recovery_min_apply_delay capability (#5181). Introduce postInitSQLRefs and postInitTemplateSQLRefs to allow users to define postInit and postInitTemplate instructions as one or more config maps or secrets (#5074). Add transparent support for PostgreSQL 17's allow_alter_system parameter, enabling or disabling the ALTER SYSTEM command through the .spec.postgresql.enableAlterSystem option (#4921). Allow overriding the query metric name and the names of the columns using a name key/value pair, which can replace the name automatically inherited from the parent key (#4779). Enhanced control over exported metrics by making them subject to the value returned by a custom query, which is run within the same transaction and defined in the predicate_query field (#4503). Allow additional arguments to be passed to barman-cloud-wal-archive and barman-cloud-wal-restore (#5099). Introduce the reconcilePodSpec annotation on the Cluster and Pooler resources to control the restart of pods following a change in the Pod specification (#5069). The readiness probe now fails for streaming replicas that were never connected to the primary instance, allowing incoherent replicas to be discovered promptly (#5206). Support the new metrics introduced in PgBouncer 1.23 in the Pooler metrics collector (#5044). cnpg plugin updates: Enhance the install generate command by adding a --control-plane option, allowing deployment of the operator on control-plane nodes by setting node affinity and tolerations (#5271). Enhance the destroy command to delete also any job related to the target instance (#5298). Enhanced the status command to display demotionToken and promotionToken when available, providing more detailed operational insights with distributed topologies (#5149). Added support for customizing the remote database name in the publication and subscription subcommands. This enhancement offers greater flexibility for synchronizing data from an external cluster with multiple databases (#5113). Security: Add TLS communication between the operator and instance manager (#4442). Add optional TLS communication for the instance metrics exporter (#4927). Fixes: Enhance the mechanism for detecting Pods that have been terminated but not deleted during an eviction process, and extend the cleanup process during maintenance windows to include unschedulable Pods when the reusePVC flag is set to false (#2056). Disable pg_rewind execution for newly created replicas that employ VolumeSnapshot during bootstrapping to avoid introducing a new shutdown checkpoint entry in the WAL files. This ensures that replicas can reconnect to the primary without issues, which would otherwise be hindered by the additional checkpoint entry (#5081). Gracefully handle failures during the initialization of a new instance. Any remaining data from the failed initialization is now either removed or, if it's a valid PostgreSQL data directory, moved to a backup location to avoid possible data loss (#5112). Enhance the robustness of the immediate backups reconciler by implementing retry logic upon initial backup failure (#4982). Wait for the postmaster to shut down before starting it again (#4938). Ensure that the Pooler service template can override the default service (#4846). Exclude immutable databases from pg_database metric monitoring and alerting processes (#4980). Removed unnecessary permissions from the operator service account (#4911). Fix cluster role permissions for ClusterImageCatalogs (#5034). Ensure the operator initiates a rollout of the Pooler instance when the operator image is upgraded (#5006) Address race condition causing the readiness probe to incorrectly show \"not ready\" after a PostgreSQL restart, even when the postmaster was accessible (#4920). Prevent reconciliation of resources that aren't owned by a Pooler (#4967). Renew the certificates managed by the operator when the DNS Subject Alternative Names (SANs) are updated (#3269, #3319). Set PVC default AccessModes in the template only when unspecified (#4845). Gracefully handle unsatisfiable backup schedule (#5109). Synchronous replication self-healing checks now exclude terminated pods, focusing only on active and functional pods (#5210). The instance manager will now terminate all existing operator-related replication connections following a role change in a replica cluster (#5209). Allow setting smartShutdownTimeout to zero, enabling immediate fast shutdown and bypassing the smart shutdown process when required (#5347). cnpg plugin: Properly handle errors during the status command execution. Support TLS in the status command (#4915). Supported versions Kubernetes 1.31, 1.30, 1.29, and 1.28 PostgreSQL 16, 15, 14, 13, and 12 PostgreSQL 16.4 is the default image PostgreSQL 12 support ends on November 12, 2024","title":"Release notes for CloudNativePG 1.24"},{"location":"release_notes/v1.24/#release-notes-for-cloudnativepg-124","text":"History of user-visible changes in the 1.24 minor release of CloudNativePG.

Version 1.25.1 Release Date: February 28, 2025 Enhancements Introduced a startup probe for the operator to enhance reliability and prevent premature liveness probe failures during initialization. (#7008) Added support for using the -r service with the Pooler. (#6868) Introduced an optional --ttl flag for the pgbench plugin, enabling automatic deletion of completed jobs after a user-defined duration. (#6701) Marked known error messages from the Azure CSI Driver for volume snapshots as retryable, improving resilience. (#6906) Updated the default PostgreSQL version to 17.4 for new cluster definitions. (#6960) Security The operator image build process has been enhanced to strengthen security and transparency. Images are now signed with cosign , and OCI attestations are generated, incorporating the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and provenance data. Additionally, OCI annotations have been added to improve traceability and ensure the integrity of the images. Bug Fixes Fixed inconsistent behavior in default probe knob values when .spec.probes is defined, ensuring users can override all settings, including failureThreshold . If unspecified in the startup probe, failureThreshold is now correctly derived from .spec.startupDelay / periodSeconds (default: 10 , now overridable). The same logic applies to liveness probes via .spec.livenessProbeTimeout . (#6656) Managed service ports now take precedence over default operator-defined ports. (#6474) Fixed an issue where WAL metrics were unavailable after an instance restart until a configuration change was applied. (#6816) Fixed an issue in monolithic database import where role import was skipped if no roles were specified. (#6646) Added support for new metrics introduced in PgBouncer 1.24.

Version 1.26.0-rc1 Release date: Mar 28, 2025 Important Changes CloudNativePG is now officially a CNCF project : CloudNativePG has been accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), marking a significant milestone in its evolution. As part of this transition, the project is now governed under CloudNativePG, a Series of LF Projects, LLC , ensuring long-term sustainability and community-driven innovation. (#7203) Deprecation of Native Barman Cloud Support : Native support for Barman Cloud backups and recovery is now deprecated and will be fully removed in CloudNativePG 1.28.0. Users must begin migrating their existing clusters to the new Barman Cloud Plugin to ensure a smooth transition. (#6876) End of Support for Barman 3.4 and Earlier : CloudNativePG no longer supports Barman versions 3.4 and earlier, including the capability detection framework. Users running older operand versions (from before April 2023) must update their operand before upgrading the operator to avoid compatibility issues. (#7220) Hibernation Command Changes : The hibernate on and hibernate off commands in the cnpg plugin for kubectl now serve as shortcuts for declarative hibernation. The previous imperative approach has been removed in favor of this method. Additionally, the hibernate status command has been removed, as its functionality is now covered by the standard status command. Warning: Do not upgrade to version 1.26 of both the plugin and the operator unless you are prepared to migrate to the declarative hibernation method. (#7155) Features: Declarative Offline In-Place Major Upgrades of PostgreSQL : Introduced support for offline in-place major upgrades when a new operand container image with a higher PostgreSQL major version is applied to a cluster. During the upgrade, all cluster pods are shut down to ensure data consistency. A new job is created to validate upgrade conditions, run pg_upgrade , and set up new directories for PGDATA , WAL files, and tablespaces as needed. Once the upgrade is complete, replicas are re-created. Failed upgrades can be rolled back declaratively. (#6664) Improved Startup and Readiness Probes for Replicas : Enhanced support for Kubernetes startup and readiness probes in PostgreSQL instances, providing greater control over replicas based on the streaming lag. (#6623) Declarative management of extensions and schemas : Introduced the extensions and schemas stanzas in the Database resource to declaratively create, modify, and drop PostgreSQL extensions and schemas within a database. (#7062) Enhancements Introduced the STANDBY_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT operator configuration setting, allowing users to specify the tcp_user_timeout parameter on all standby instances managed by the operator. (#7036) Added the pg_extensions metric, providing information about installed PostgreSQL extensions and their latest available versions. (#7195) Introduced the DRAIN_TAINTS operator configuration option, enabling users to customize which node taints indicate a node is being drained. This replaces the previous fixed behavior of only recognizing node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable as a drain signal. Added the KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN configuration option to the operator, allowing users to specify the domain suffix for fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) generated within the Kubernetes cluster. If not set, it defaults to cluster.local . (#6989) Added support for LZ4, XZ, and Zstandard compression methods when archiving WAL files via Barman Cloud ( deprecated ). (#7151) Implemented the cnpg.io/validation annotation, enabling users to disable the validation webhook on CloudNativePG-managed resources. Use with caution, as this allows unrestricted changes. (#7196) Added support for patching PostgreSQL instance pods using the cnpg.io/podPatch annotation with a JSON Patch. This may introduce discrepancies between the operator\u2019s expectations and Kubernetes behavior, so it should be used with caution. (#6323) Added support for collecting pg_stat_wal metrics in PostgreSQL 18.

(#7126) Fixes Resolved a race condition that caused the operator to perform two switchovers when updating the PostgreSQL configuration. (#6991) Corrected the PodMonitor configuration by adjusting the matchLabels scope for the targeted pooler and cluster pods. Previously, the matchLabels were too broad, inadvertently inheriting labels from the cluster and leading to data collection from unintended targets. (#7063) Added a webhook warning for clusters with a missing unit (e.g., MB, GB) in the shared_buffers configuration. This will become an error in future releases. Users should update their configurations to include explicit units (e.g., 512MB instead of 512 ).

The same method can be used to perform major PostgreSQL upgrades on a new cluster. The feature introduces two types of import: microservice (import one database only in the new cluster) and monolith (import the selected databases and roles from the existing instance). Anti-affinity rules for synchronous replication based on labels: make sure that synchronous replicas are running on nodes with different characteristics than the node where the primary is running, for example, availability zone Enhancements: Improve fencing by removing the existing limitation that disables failover when one or more instances are fenced Enhance the automated extension management framework by checking whether an extension exists in the catalog instead of running DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS unnecessarily Improve logging of the instance manager during switchover and failover Enable redefining the name of the database of the application, its owner, and the related secret when recovering from an object store or cloning an instance via pg_basebackup (this was only possible in the initdb bootstrap so far) Backup and recovery: Require Barman >= 3.0.0 for future support of PostgreSQL 15 Enable Azure AD Workload Identity for Barman Cloud backups through the inheritFromAzureAD option Introduce barmanObjectStore.s3Credentials.region to define the region in AWS ( AWS_DEFAULT_REGION ) for both backup and recovery object stores Support for Kubernetes 1.24 Changes: Set the default operand image to PostgreSQL 15.0 Use conditions from the Kubernetes API instead of relying on our own implementation for backup and WAL archiving Fixes: Fix the initialization order inside the WithActiveInstance function that starts the CSV log pipe for the PostgreSQL server, ensuring proper logging in the cluster initialization phase - this is especially useful in bootstrap operations like recovery from a backup are failing (before this patch, such logs were not sent to the standard output channel and were permanently lost) Avoid an unnecessary switchover when a hot standby sensitive parameter is decreased, and the primary has already restarted Properly quote role names in ALTER ROLE statements Backup and recovery: Fix the algorithm detecting the closest Barman backup for PITR, which was comparing the requested recovery timestamp with the backup start instead of the end Fix Point in Time Recovery based on a transaction ID, a named restore point, or the \u201cimmediate\u201d target by providing a new field called backupID in the recoveryTarget section Fix encryption parameters invoking barman-cloud-wal-archive and barman-cloud-backup commands Stop ignoring barmanObjectStore.serverName option when recovering from a backup object store using a server name that doesn\u2019t match the current cluster name cnpg plug-in: Make sure that the plug-in complies with the -n parameter when specified by the user Fix the status command to sort results and remove variability in the output","title":"Version 1.16.0"},{"location":"release_notes/old/v1.17/","text":"Release notes for CloudNativePG 1.17 History of user-visible changes in the 1.17 minor release of CloudNativePG.

If you are upgrading from a previous version, please carefully read the \"Important Changes\" section below, as well as the upgrade documentation. Features: Volume Snapshot support for backup and recovery: leverage the standard Kubernetes API on Volume Snapshots to take advantage of capabilities like incremental and differential copy for both backup and recovery operations. This first step, covering cold backups from a standby, will continue in 1.22 with support for hot backups using the PostgreSQL API and tablespaces. OLM installation method : introduce support for Operator Lifecycle Manager via OperatorHub.io for the latest patch version of the latest minor release through the stable channel.

Version 1.22.5 Release date: Jul 29, 2024 Warning This is expected to be the last release in the 1.22.X series. Users are encouraged to update to a newer minor version soon. Enhancements: Add transparent support for PostgreSQL 17's allow_alter_system parameter, enabling or disabling the ALTER SYSTEM command through the .spec.postgresql.enableAlterSystem option (#4921). Introduce the reconcilePodSpec annotation on the Cluster and Pooler resources to control the restart of pods following a change in the Pod specification (#5069). Support the new metrics introduced in PgBouncer 1.23 in the Pooler metrics collector (#5044).

Additionally, we've extended the supplementary support period for the previous minor release to 3 months. Features: PostgreSQL Image Catalogs: Introduced ClusterImageCatalog and ImageCatalog CRDs to manage operand container images based on PostgreSQL major version. This is facilitated through the Cluster 's .spec.imageCatalogRef stanza . This feature provides an alternative to the imageName option and will eventually replace it as the default method to define operand container images. User-Defined Replication Slots: Enhanced the synchronization of physical replication slots to cover user-defined replication slots on the primary, via the newly introduced stanza replicationSlots.synchronizeReplicas . Configuration of Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB) : Introduced the .spec.enablePDB field to disable PDBs on the primary instance, allowing proper eviction of the pod during maintenance operations. This is particularly useful for single-instance deployments. This feature is intended to replace the node maintenance window feature.

This feature provides an alternative to the imageName option and will eventually replace it as the default method to define operand container images. User-Defined Replication Slots: Enhanced the synchronization of physical replication slots to cover user-defined replication slots on the primary, via the newly introduced stanza replicationSlots.synchronizeReplicas . Configuration of Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB) : Introduced the .spec.enablePDB field to disable PDBs on the primary instance, allowing proper eviction of the pod during maintenance operations. This is particularly useful for single-instance deployments.
